Switzerland is home to seemingly endless natural beauty as well as a rich cultural history, ensuring there’s something to discover that will astound you. Read our list of the 20 must-visit attractions that you simply have to see for yourself.

Lake Geneva
One of the largest lakes in Western Europe, Lake Geneva has plenty to keep you enthralled. From Geneva on the western shores to the town of Montreux on the east, you’re treated to views of the Alps reflecting of the lake’s calm waters. In the summer, you can indulge in a number of water sports.


The Lion of Lucerne
In 1792, members of the Swiss Guard were massacred during the French Revolution. A couple of decades later, Lukas Ahorn carved the tragic Lion in its death throes into a rock face outside of Lucerne. The relief was designed by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.


Great St. Bernard Pass
The Great St. Bernard Pass is the oldest pass in the Western Alps and the third highest in Switzerland. At the highest point in the road is the Great St. Bernard Hospice, where St. Bernard rescue dogs gained their fame.


Old Town of Bern
On a wander through the exquisitely preserved old town of Bern, you can feel the city’s history close in around you as you come across 15th-century arcades and 16th-century Renaissance fountains.


Rhaetian Railway
The Rhaetian Railway connects Switzerland to Italy through the mountains of Graubünden and is a remarkable feat of engineering through one of the country’s most photogenic regions. On the 130km ride, you’ll pass over 196 bridges and go through 55 tunnels, with the curving Landwasser viaduct being a spectacular highlight.


Lavaux Vineyards
Vineyards stretch as far as the eyes can see in Switzerland’s longest vineyard region (843 hectares to be precise). On a leisurely hike along the vineyard trail, you can stop by and taste some of the local produce for yourself. Just remember you have to walk back.


Trümmelbach Falls
The Lauterbrunen valley, also known as the valley of the 72 falls is home to the Trümmelbach Falls, the largest series of subterranean waterfalls in Europe. They carry the meltwater from the Jungfrau down to the valley below and they are fully accessible by lift, tunnels and paths.

Bahnhofstrasse
One of the most beautiful and expensive shopping streets in Europe, the Bahnhofstrasse is a must visit on any trip to Zurich. Whether you are in the market for designer goods or just want the experience, make sure to take a wander through.

Gruyères
Gruyères is the cheese capital of Switzerland and the world famous cheese for fondue, aptly named Les Gruyères, is made there. Even if you’re not a fan of cheese, you should still visit as the town’s cream and meringue dessert is a must-taste.
Château Chillon
Situated on a tiny island on Lake Geneva, Château Chillon is the most beautiful castle in Switzerland, offering stunning views of the surrounding Alps.


Jungfraujoch
Otherwise known as the Roof of Europe, here you can admire the Alps in all their splendour. You can journey to Europe’s highest-altitude railway station at 3454m above sea level.

Matterhorn
The Matterhorn is known as the world’s most photographed mountain in the world for a reason. Head to the fully pedestrianized resort of Zermatt if you want to tackle the challenge of climbing the mountain or ski on top-class slopes in its shadow.

Schilthorn
Keeping on the trend of things at high altitude, at the Schilthorn summit you can dine out at just under 3000 metres in a revolving restaurant. From the viewpoint, it’s possible to see the Jungfrau, the Jura mountain range, the Vosges Mountains and catch a glimpse of the Mont Blanc in the distance.


Aletsch glacier
The Aletsch glacier is the largest in the Alps at 23 km long. You can take a trek and get right up close to one of nature’s most spectacular bulldozers.

Kapellbrücke
The oldest covered wooden bridge in Europe stretches across Lake Lucerne, with its structure dating back to the 14th century. Much of the bridge is a modern reconstruction after it was destroyed by a fire in the 90s. The interior of the Kapellbrücke contains artwork from the 17th century depicting important events in Swiss history.

Rhine Falls
At 125 metres wide and 25 metres high, the spectacular cascading waters of the Rhine Falls is the largest plains waterfall in Europe.

Jet d’eau
As one local Swiss comedian said, the Genevois are so proud of their tiny part of Lac Léman, or Lake Geneva, they decided to fire it hundreds of feet into the air. The Jet d’eau is one of the unmissable, if rather puzzling, sites of Geneva.

The Abbey of St Gall
This UNESCO World Heritage Site contains one of the oldest medieval libraries in the world and was one of the most important abbeys in Europe from the 8th century to the 19th. The structure we see today is the result of eight centuries of restructuring.

Lake Lugano
By Lake Lugano, with its Mediterranean climate, palm trees and the sound of Italian being spoken, you could easily forget that you are in Switzerland. Surrounded by mountains and blessed with fine weather, it makes for the perfect place for a relaxing getaway.

The castles of Bellinzona
The Castelgrande, Castello Montebello and Castello Sasso Corbaro protected the city of the Bellinzona, the capital of the canton of Ticino. Each castle is worth a visit by its own right, but together with their defensive walls they offer a fascinatingly beautiful step back in time.


Switzerland is expensive. That's old news.
Wherever you go and whatever you buy, you'll find yourself spending a lot more than you would anywhere else. Unless you're travelling in Bermuda or Norway.
But for a budget traveller, our high prices can be a real turn-off. Which is a shame because Switzerland is a fantastic place to visit.
I mean, would you say no to this?



Yeah, me neither. So let's not get caught up in this downward spiral and focus on some positives instead, shall we? Because if you think about it, even this annoying aspect comes with its plus side.
It makes anything free seem like an absolute steal.
Think about it...
Finding a free museum in Switzerland is a heaps more exciting than in one of those super budget-friendly countries like Poland or Croatia. And the best game plan to protect your budget is to hunt down as many free activities as possible.
Which is exactly what this post is going to help you with. Are you ready to find out what they are?
(Spoiler alert. Some of the following 25 suggestions are probably not what you expected. Free biscuits, anyone?)

1. Culinary
1.1 Go cookie-crazy at the Kambly factory store
If you like free biscuits and beautiful landscapes, the Kambly factory store in the idyllic village of Trubschachen will feel like Christmas and Easter all at once. With up to 100 types of delicious biscuits to freely devour, this place will keep you busy for a while.
And full...
Or sick. Depending on how far you take it. And I have yet to meet someone who didn't take it too far.
For an in-depth rundown of the Kambly store adventure, visit this article.

Eat free biscuits at the Kambly factory store...

... and buy a bag or two for your trip.
1.2 Refill your water bottle
Switzerland is also known as "the water castle of Europe", which makes buying bottled water completely redundant. Drinking water is all over the place and opportunities to refill your bottle are endless.
Zurich alone has 1.200 public fountains and Lucerne even created a water guide to help you find your closest refilling station. Unless you see a sign telling you otherwise ("kein Trinkwasser", "eau non potable" or "aqua non potabile"), you're good to go.
Opinions on drinking from mountain streams are divided, though. I personally avoid it whenever I can...
1.3 Say cheese
Oh boy, Swiss cheese. Don't get me started...
Nothing I've ever tasted abroad came even close to what we have here. Swiss cheese is just the best. I occasionally get called a cheese snob for saying that during my travels, but I'll take it. 
The coolest part about having 450 different types of cheese is visiting one of the many cheese dairies.
Here's a list of places that let you enter for free. Mind you, some of them charge a little extra for the tasting at the end or to see a special section of their dairy. But for a general impression of the Swiss cheese-making procedure, you don't have to pay for the following vendors:
	•	Cheese dairy in St-Imier
	•	Cheese dairy in Engelberg
	•	Cheese dairy in Einsiedeln
	•	Cheese dairy in Airolo
	•	Emmental cheese dairy in Affoltern
	•	Cheese dairy in Marbach
	•	Cheese dairy in Glis

There are over 450 types of cheese in Switzerland.

Some cheese dairies let you watch their working process.
Oh, and if you happen to turn into a cheese snob after your trip to Switzerland, please let me know. One can never have too many allies...
2. Transport
2.1 Use free public transport
Public transport in Switzerland isn't cheap. But luckily, several Swiss cities offer free use of public transport to their visitors.
Upon check-in at your accommodation in Bern, Basel, Lucerne, Lausanne, Montreux, Geneva and the whole Canton of Ticino, you receive a ticket that lets you use local transport for free during the time of your stay.
More and more cities seem to be adopting this concept, so check with your accommodation if they offer some sort of a tourist card upon arrival.

The Ticino Ticket takes you to Lavertezzo in the Verzasca valley for free...

Just like the Montreux Riviera Card lets you freely use local public transport in Montreux.
2.2 Grab a free bike
In some cities, you can borrow free bikes through a platform called Schweizrollt. All you need to do is leave a deposit and/or some sort of identification and off you go.
The cities currently participating in Schweizrollt are Zurich, Geneva, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, Neuchâtel and the Canton of Valais. You can also grab a free bike in St. Gallen by heading to the train station and following the signs to the "Velostation".
If you're looking to rent a bike elsewhere, your alternative options are Nextbike, Publibike, Velospot and SBB. Those aren't free, though.
3. Culture
3.1 Tag along on a free walking tour
The concept of free walking tours has become hugely popular over the past couple of years. You can find them anywhere from La Paz to Paris and Tokyo all the way down to Sydney.
It's an idea that has taken off globally and still continues to grow. And here's how this works.
A highly motivated, talkative and usually local guide takes you around a city for a couple of hours. This makes for tons of local knowledge, random facts and interesting stories.
Since those tours operate on tips alone, you basically join for free and decide at the end how much it was worth to you.
If you felt like it sucked, you can just sneak off. But they almost always go above and beyond to entertain and inform you so leaving a decent tip is kind of a no-brainer.
As of May 2019, free walking tours exist in thirteen Swiss cities. To find one that suits your taste and schedule, head over to the official Freewalk website.

Free walking tours exist in Zurich...

... Bern and many other Swiss cities.
3.2 Peek around our churches
Switzerland has a wide array of impressive churches and cathedrals to show off. To my knowledge, they're all free to enter. (If you happen to find one that takes an entrance fee, I'd like to apologise in advance.)
Certain churches, like for example St. Ursus Cathedral in Solothurn, Grossmünster in Zurich, Laurenzenkirche in St. Gallen or Basler Münster in Basel, give you the opportunity to climb the tower for a small fee.
Don't miss this if you're after postcard and Instagram-worthy views of the city and its surroundings.

Cathedral in St. Gallen

St. Ursus Cathedral in Solothurn
3.3 Take a good look at the city model in Zurich
If you're into architecture and city planning, you're going to love the city model in Zurich. This wooden replica of Switzerland's biggest city shows over 50.000 existing buildings as well as the city's major planned projects.
You can find the city model in the basement of the Department of City Planning, which is situated at Lindenhofstrasse 19 in Zurich.
By the way, it's not uncommon to burst into a meeting here as this room also serves as a conference room. But as long as you keep your voice down and don't interrupt any important discussions, you can still take a look at the model.

The city model of Zurich in the Department of City Planning
3.4 Join a free tour of the Swiss Parliament Building
Understanding the Swiss political system can be as difficult as nailing jelly to a tree.
I could drift off into open waters here and start explaining our direct democracy and how our Head of State consists of seven people instead of just one person.
But I won't.
Instead, if you're interested in all those political questions and our Parliament Building, you can join one of their free Parliament tours. To reserve your spot, use this booking form.

The Swiss Parliament Building regularly runs free tours.

Don't miss this if you're interested in Swiss politics.
3.5 Visit a free museum
With over 1.100 museums scattered across the country, anyone should be able to find something to their taste here. 
And the best part is that roughly a third of our museums are free.
Not the big ones like Technorama in Winterthur or the Museum of Communication in Bern. But CERN in Geneva and the Nature Museum in Solothurn, for instance, are free to enter.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find a conclusive list in English, but I did find something helpful in German.
It's a list of all the Swiss museums. If you visit this website, scroll down to "5. Alle Schweizer Museen" and sort them by price, the free ones will appear at the top.
By the way, if you're travelling with a Swiss Travel Pass, you automatically own the Swiss Museum Pass as well. This gives you free entrance to all the places listed here. (Spoiler alert: Certain chocolate factories also count as museums and are included in this pass)


Find the perfect itinerary
for your trip to Switzerland...
3.6 Slow down
Travelling can be exhausting when you power through a ridiculously crammed itinerary.
And while it may seem reasonable to tick off as many places as possible, this can cause us (yes, this happens to me, too) to miss what's right in front of us. All the free stuff that's almost too obvious to notice.
So next time you find yourself racing from museum to monument to must-do activity, spending way too much money in the process, slow down.
Take a couple of hours getting lost in a city. Stroll through its little alleyways, check out its churches and shops or find a cosy spot by the lake or river.

The Mannenweier in St. Gallen is the perfect place for swimming and enjoying some down-time.

As is the Aaremüürli, the stonewall by the Aare River in Solothurn.
3.7 Party at a free festival
Free festivals, parties and markets take place all year round.
Be that a street food festival, a local party like "Märetfescht" in Solothurn or "em Beppi si Jazz" in Basel, a buskers festival, the yearly madness during carnival, one of the countless fun fairs, open-air festivals or concerts or whatever else your heart desires.
The best place to find out what's happening in your area is the Swiss Events app. It maintains an up-to-date list with everything that's going on in Switzerland.
3.8 Explore our mighty castles
Castles might not be the main attraction you were expecting to find in Switzerland, right?
But you'd be surprised at how many awesome castles we have. Like for instance Chateau de Chillon by Lake Geneva, Gruyères Castle in the Canton of Fribourg or Lenzburg Castle in the Canton of Aargau. Just to name a few.
Unfortunately, most of them aren't free to enter. But since castles are just as impressive from the outside as they are from the inside, you can still enjoy them for free without going in.
To find the most beautiful ones, visit the Swiss castle website.
PS: If you're travelling with a Swiss Travel Pass, several castles are included in your free Swiss Museum Pass.

Chateau de Chillon near Montreux is one of my favourites.

Aarburg Castle is a juvenile prison. Who'd have thought?
4. Nature
4.1 Take a stroll through our botanical gardens
Botanical gardens are nearly as abundant in Switzerland as museums.
Almost every city and every university offering a plant-related study programme has a publicly available garden with indigenous and foreign plants.
To find a botanical garden in your area, use the search form on the the official Swiss Tourism website.
4.2 Stand in the mist of Europe's largest waterfall
The Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen are one spectacular force of nature.
During summer, around 600.000 litres of water plummet down this 150 metres wide (492 feet) and 23 metres tall (75 feet) waterfall.
Access from the northern shore is free while viewing Europe's largest waterfall from the south costs 5 CHF. This fee includes the viewing platforms as well as the entrance to Laufen Castle, which also serves as a Youth Hostel, right above the Rhine Falls.

The Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen are Europe's largest waterfalls.
4.3 Wander through the Lavaux vineyards
The Lavaux vineyards are the perfect place for wine and/or nature lovers.
Stretching all the way from Lausanne to Montreux, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of my favourite spots in western Switzerland. And completely free to access if you don't stop for a glass of wine along the way.
Not only is it super peaceful to get lost in those little pathways winding through the vineyards, the spectacular views over Lake Geneva and into the Swiss and French Alps are also unparallelled.
The easiest way to reach the vineyards is by local train from either Montreux or Lausanne. Get off in Epesses, Villette or anywhere else along the way and make your way uphill. Or follow the directions on this website. 

The Lavaux vineyards by Lake Geneva are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

It's the perfect place to take a stroll through the vineyards and go on a boat ride on Lake Geneva.
4.4 Dip your toes - pretty much anywhere
As you know from earlier, Switzerland is the water castle of Europe. With roughly 1.500 lakes scattered across the country, you're never too far from an opportunity to go for a swim.
Cute little ponds, freezing cold mountain lakes, refreshing rivers and our bigger lakes attract water lovers all year round for all sorts of activities.
Unless you see a sign telling you otherwise, you're good to hop in. Just be careful when you go for a swim in a river. Those currents don't always do what you expect them to.
By the way, my favourite mountain lakes are Seealpsee in the Alpstein mountain range, Oeschinensee in the Canton of Bern and Riffelsee right in front of the Matterhorn in Zermatt.

The River Aare has some amazing spots to go for a swim.

Seealpsee is one of my favourite mountain lakes.
4.5 Hike until your feet fall off
With the Alps making up a whopping two-thirds of Switzerland's land mass, your hiking opportunities over here are endless.
If you summed up all the official hiking trails across Switzerland, you'd end up with roughly 65.000 kilometres (40.400 miles) worth of trails. Put into perspective, that's one and a half times the world's circumference.
Or 18.5 times the Appalachian Trail. As you can see, hiking is a free activity that can technically keep you busy for years. 
To plan your hike, use the Schweizmobil website or download their app.

Hiking in the Alpstein mountain range

Hiking to Creux du Van in the Canton of Jura.
4.6 Walk across the world's longest pedestrian suspension bridge
An incredibly head spinning adventure is hiking across the world’s longest pedestrian suspension bridge near Zermatt. 
This masterpiece of a bridge opened in 2017 and stretches 494 metres (1.620 feet) across the valley. The circular track leading across the bridge starts and finishes in Randa, which can be reached in 15 minutes by train from Zermatt.

The suspension bridge in Randa near Zermatt is the world's longest of its kind.
4.7 Visit the Swiss National Park
Most national parks in the world make you pay to enter. But guess what. The Swiss don't.
Founded in 1914, the Swiss National Park in the Canton of Grisons is the oldest national park in the Alps. It offers 80 kilometres (50 miles) of hiking trails that take you through breathtaking landscapes.
The park is also home to various native animals such as marmots, ibex, deer, chamois, jackdaws and many more.
Getting to the main entrance in Zernez is a bit of a mission but not really a problem with the Swiss public transport system.

The Swiss National Park is a hikers' paradise.

And it's free to access, too...
4.8 Go stargazing
In case you've never seen the Milky Way galaxy before, or you just like stars in general, you're in luck. Find a remote spot with little light pollution, look up and wait for those shooting stars to roll in.
Another option is to bring your tent and spend the night outside. Like I mentioned in this post, wild camping is legal in Switzerland. Or at least not illegal...
5. Animals
5.1 Spend some quality time with the bears
Figuratively speaking, of course.
If you happen to visit Switzerland's capital, make sure you stop by the bear park, which lies at the lower end of the old town of Bern. Unless you're there during hibernation time, you'll be able to observe Björk, Finn, Ursina and Berna go about their daily bear's lives.

The bear park in Bern lies at the lover end of the old town, right by the River Aare.

It's only a short walk from there up to Rosengarten, a beautiful garden overlooking the Swiss capital.
5.2 Hang out at a free wildlife park
Several wildlife parks across Switzerland are free to enter and make for a great afternoon trip. Here's a collection of beautiful parks that also teach you a fact or two about the Swiss wildlife.
	•	Wildpark Roggenhausen in Aarau
	•	Tierpark Lange Erlen in Basel
	•	Tierpark in Biel
	•	Alpine Park in Interlaken
	•	Tierpark in Langenthal
	•	Peter & Paul in St. Gallen
	•	Wildpark Bruderhaus in Winterthur
	•	Wildnispark in Zurich
	•	Wildpark Heitern in Zofingen

The marmot, or "Murmeli" as we call it, lives at Peter & Paul Wildlife Park in St. Gallen. And in the National Park, of course.
5.3 Stop by the retired horses of Le Roselet
Tucked away in a village called Les Breuleux in the Canton of Jura, the horse foundation Le Roselet runs a nursing station for retired horses.
Close to 60 elderly horses, ponies and donkeys have found their retirement home here and can be visited all year round.
If heading all the way to Les Breuleux to check out some horses seems a bit out of scale for you, you can always combine the visit with a hike in the Jura mountain range. Trails can be found and planned through Schweizmobil.
5.4 Observe the storks in Switzerland's largest stork station
The stork station in Altreu was brought to life in 1950 when storks in Switzerland were almost extinct. Max Bloesch, a committed sports teacher, worked on bringing the storks back to Switzerland and eventually, his endeavours paid off.
Today, over 40 breeding pairs enjoy their summers soaring through the air, strutting across the fields and clattering on the rooftops in Altreu.
If you're in the Solothurn area, don't miss out on a couple of relaxing hours in this charming spot next to the River Aare.

Altreu is a beautiful place by the River Aare.

It's home to over 40 stork breeding pairs. Can't miss 'em.
Zip that wallet
And this completes our hunt for free things to do in Switzerland. As you can see, there's plenty of stuff to do around here that doesn't require you to open your wallet.
I'm sure this list isn't conclusive so if you happen to bump into any additional free activities you'd like to share, please let us know in the comments below.

Things to do Geneva

Hawaii's current craze for stand-up paddleboarding comes to Lake Geneva. The idea is to stand upright on a long surfboard and use a paddle to propel yourself across the water. It's a fun way to travel, as long as you're prepared to fall in once in a while, and a good upper-body workout. There are plenty of other watersports, such as windsurfing and wakeboarding, on the lake. Book lessons at Tropical Geneva and reward yourself afterwards with a drink on the palm-fringed beach, a more secluded location than the main yacht-crammed marina.

15 Top-Rated Tourist Attractions in Switzerland
Written by Karen Hastings and Diana Bocco
Sep 9, 2019

For ravishing alpine scenery and quaint villages oozing storybook charm, it's hard to beat Switzerland. The soaring snow-capped peaks of the Alps, glittering blue lakes, emerald valleys, glaciers, and picturesque lakeside hamlets imbue this landlocked nation with a fairytale beauty. Snuggled amid the mountain valleys and lakes lie world-class international resorts and a long list of things to do, including hiking, biking, climbing, paragliding, skiing, and tobogganing.

Travelers come here for jaw-dropping scenery but are charmed by the many cultural attractions. Steeped in history, cities such as Zurich, Geneva, and Lausanne offer excellent museums and galleries, historic buildings, and renowned music festivals. The capital is Bern with a stunning medieval old town hugging the crook of a river. Germany, Italy, Austria, and France border Switzerland, and their languages and customs infuse this country with a multicultural sophistication.

From the Italian architecture of palm-studded Ticino to the dialects of Swiss-German and Latin-derived Romansch, Switzerland can sometimes feel like several countries in one—yet all with the slick packaging and punctuality for which it is famous.

Plan your trip and explore the best sites with our list of the top tourist attractions in Switzerland.

1. The Matterhorn

The Matterhorn
The Matterhorn, Switzerland's iconic pointed peak is one of the highest mountains in the Alps. On the border with Italy, this legendary peak rises to 4,478 meters, and its four steep faces lie in the direction of the compass points. The first summiting in 1865 ended tragically when four climbers fell to their death during the descent. Today, thousands of experienced climbers come here each summer.

At the foot of this mighty peak, lies the charming village of Zermatt, a top international resort with horse-drawn carriage rides, quaint chalets, and world-class restaurants and hotels. To preserve the air quality and peaceful ambiance, motorized vehicles are banned in the village.

In the winter, skiers can schuss down more than 300 kilometers of slopes. In the summer, swimming and tennis are popular pursuits as well as hiking, biking, and climbing in the surrounding mountains. Summer glacier skiing is also available.

2. Jungfraujoch: The Top of Europe

Jungfraujoch: The Top of Europe
One of the most popular things to do in the beautiful Bernese Oberland is the train journey to Jungfraujoch, the "Top of Europe," with an observation terrace and scientific observatory perched at 3,454 meters. The longest glacier in Europe, the Great Aletsch Glacier begins at Jungfraujoch, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The famous Eiger Trail from the Eiger glacier station to Alpiglen clings to the rocks at the foot of the north face.

Other popular walks include Panorama Way to the sunny, south-facing First slope; the Gletscherschlucht (Glacier Gorge); and Öpfelchüechliwäg, the high-altitude trail from Holenstein to Brandegg through fields of flowers, alpine pastures, and woodlands. The less active can ride gondolas and cable cars to scenic viewpoints over the Lauterbrunnen Valley.

Picturesque Grindelwald is a glacier village in the Jungfrau region, which makes a great base for adventures into the surrounding mountains. It nestles at the base of snow-cloaked mountains and is one of Switzerland's oldest and most popular resorts. Towering above this alpine valley is the tiara-shaped Wetterhorn and the sheer north face of the Eiger, one of the planet's most dramatic and difficult climbs. Between the mountains lie Grindelwald's two glinting glaciers. For the best views, Faulhorn, at 2,681 meters, offers breathtaking panoramas of the giant peaks.

3. Interlaken

Interlaken
Nestled between Lake Thun to the west and Lake Brienz to the east, Interlaken is one of Switzerland's most popular summer holiday resorts. In the center of town, Höhematte is a marvel of urban planning with 35 acres of open space. Flower gardens, hotels, and cafés surround the Höheweg, the main boulevard through here with breathtaking vistas of the mountains. The mighty peaks of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau tower above the town providing excellent opportunities for alpine adventures. Hiking, climbing, abseiling, and kayaking are prime pursuits.

More than 45 mountain railways, cable cars, chairlifts, and ski lifts transport visitors into the surrounding countryside and offer plenty of chances for sightseeing from up above. In the winter, skiers and snowboarders can take their pick from the surrounding resorts and cross-country ski along the extensive trail network. In the summer, paragliders launch from Beatenberg-Niederhorn. To admire the scenery from lower elevations, hop aboard a paddle steamer for a cruise around the lakes.

4. Lucerne

Lucerne
Imagine a sparkling blue lake surrounded by mountains, a car-free medieval old town, covered bridges, waterfront promenades, frescoed historic buildings, and sun-splashed plazas with bubbling fountains. No wonder Lucerne (in German, Luzern) is a top spot for tourists. Famed for its music concerts, this quintessential Swiss town lures renowned soloists, conductors, and orchestras to its annual International Music Festival. The Culture and Convention Center is home to one of the world's leading concert halls.

One of the city's most famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge, built in the 14th century. In a small park, lies the famous Lion Monument, a poignant sculpture of a dying lion, which honors the heroic death of Swiss Guards during the attack on the Tuileries in the French Revolution. History buffs will enjoy the Swiss Transport Museum with extensive exhibits on all forms of transport, including air and space travel, railroad locomotives, and a Planetarium.

For beautiful views of Lucerne, the Alps, and the lake, ride the funicular to the Dietschiberg on the north side of Lake Lucerne; cruise up Mt. Pilatus on the cableway; or head to the Rigi, a famous lookout point.

5. Lake Geneva

Lake Geneva
Lake Geneva, Europe's largest Alpine lake, straddles the Swiss/French border, and laps at the shores of some of Switzerland's most popular cities. The city of Geneva (in French Genève; in German Genf) sits between pretty snow-capped peaks at the point where the Rhône spills into Lake Geneva.

This French-speaking "capital of peace" is the European seat of the United Nations and exudes a pleasing blend of French joie de vivre and Swiss structure. Promenades, parks, and gardens surround the lake, and the old town is a lovely spot to stroll among the historic buildings. The Jet d'Eau, a fountain in Lake Geneva shooting water 150 meters into the air, is a famous landmark. Cultural attractions include the Opera House and the Grand Théâtre, which stages international acts.

Also on the lake, about 62 kilometers from Geneva, Lausanne boasts lovely views over the surrounding region and the lake, with the Alps rising in the distance. Take a stroll through the medieval old town with its cute cafés and boutiques and stunning Gothic cathedral. At the foot of the Alps, on Lake Geneva, Montreux hosts the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival in June/July.

6. Chateau de Chillon, Montreux

Chateau de Chillon, Montreux
On the shores of Lake Geneva, near Montreux, the Chateau de Chillon (Chillon Castle) has inspired artists and writers for centuries. Lord Byron, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Victor Hugo are among the luminaries who have written about this architectural treasure.

Once the stronghold of the Counts and Dukes of Savoy from the 12th century, the complex encompasses about 25 buildings clustered around three courtyards. Highlights include the Great Halls, with magnificent views of Lake Geneva; the Gothic underground rooms; the Chapel, adorned with 14th-century paintings; and the Camera Domini, a bedroom occupied by the Duke of Savoy decorated with medieval murals.

Accommodation: Where to Stay in Montreux

7. St. Moritz

St. Moritz
Mirror-like lakes, glaciers, jagged peaks, alpine forests, and oodles of sunshine make St. Moritz one of the world's top mountain destinations and a must-have on your list of things to do in Switzerland. Palatial hotels and pricey restaurants are par for the course at this chic resort town, which has hosted two winter Olympics.

Sitting in an alpine valley 1,800 meters above sea level, the town is divided into two parts: St. Moritz Dorf sits on a sunny terrace overlooking the Lake of St. Moritz. The other part of town, lakeside St. Moritz Bad on the valley floor, is a health resort with less expensive lodging. Winter sports run the gamut, from skiing, snowboarding, skating, and bobsledding to tobogganing on the famous 1.2-kilometer-long Cresta Run.

In the summer, hiking, biking, and water sports abound. Glacier skiing is also available in the summer. Adding to all this spectacular mountain scenery, St. Moritz is a cultural crossroads. Romansch, German, Italian, French, and English are all spoken in the surrounding areas—not to mention the different languages of the many well-heeled international visitors and expats.

8. Bern

Bern
In a stunning location, perched on a peninsula of the River Aare, the Swiss capital of Bern exudes old world charm, and the city's medieval old town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Strolling along the cobbled streets, visitors can explore the tallest cathedral in Switzerland, with panoramic views from its tower; 16th-century fountains; the Zytglogge medieval clock tower with moving puppets; and six kilometers of shopping arcades, called "Lauben" by the locals. The Rose Garden (Rosengarten) offers beautiful views of the old town center.

Bern has many tourist attractions waiting to be discovered, including many excellent museums. Art lovers will appreciate the impressive galleries, including the Zentrum Paul Klee, the world's largest collection of works by this famous artist, and the Bern Museum of Art (Kunstmuseum). Don't miss the markets, held in the Bundesplatz (parliament square) with views of the elegant Renaissance-style parliament building (Bundeshaus). Families will also enjoy a visit to the Bear Park.

9. Lake Lugano and Ticino

Lake Lugano and Ticino
Lake Lugano lies on the Swiss/Italian border in Ticino, Switzerland's only official Italian-speaking canton, and offers a tantalizing taste of the Mediterranean. Citrus, figs, palms, and pomegranates flourish in the mild climate here—even as snow-capped peaks beckon in the distance. In the towns around Lake Lugano and Lake Maggiore to the west, the feel of Italy is unmistakable in the architecture, the piazzas, and the passion for fine food, which spills over the Italian borders from the south, east, and west.

Visitors can explore the area by touring the lake on one of the white steamers or renting a boat. For a panoramic overview, Monte San Salvatore offers one of the most spectacular vistas of the surrounding countryside, lake, and snow-capped peaks.

Lugano, a financial center and the largest and most significant town in Ticino, is a popular summer resort. Northwest of Lugano, in sun-drenched Locarno on Lake Maggiore, Swiss lakeside living takes on a subtropical touch with warm days, blossoming gardens, and palm-studded estates. In Bellinzona, capital of the canton, three magnificent castles are UNESCO World Heritage sites.

10. Zurich

Zurich
Zurich is Switzerland's largest city, a major transportation hub, and a top starting point for travelers. The city lies at the northwestern end of Lake Zurich astride the river Limmat. Beyond its buttoned-up façade, this affluent banking capital boasts a rich line-up of cultural treasures.

A great place to begin a walking tour is the cobbled streets of the Old Town with its quaint shops, cafés, and galleries. Mile-long Bahnhofstrasse, one of Europe's finest shopping strands, beckons with designer stores selling fashion, watches, and jewelry.

Venturing away from the boutiques, visitors will find more than 50 museums and 100 art galleries, as well as many other tourist attractions. A top pick is the Kunsthaus Zürich, the museum of fine arts, with an impressive collection of art from the Middle Ages to the present day. Another favorite is the Rietberg Museum, focusing on non-European art with many works from China, India, and Africa.

A short stroll from Zürich's main station, the Swiss National Museum, in a Gothic chateau, spotlights Swiss cultural history. Families will love the Zurich Zoo with an elephant park, penguin parade, and Madagascar pavilion. From the city, take a train ride to Uetliberg Mountain for panoramic views of the city and countryside.

11. The Rhine Falls

The Rhine Falls
Spanning 150 meters, the Rhine Falls (Rheinfall) at Schaffhausen are the largest falls in Central Europe. The best time to visit is during June and July when the mountain snow melts, and the falls swell in volume to spill over a 21-meter-high ledge of Jurassic limestone.

Boat trips up the Rhine provide excellent views of the falls, as do the viewing platforms on both sides of the river.

Accommodation: Where to Stay in Schaffhausen

12. Swiss National Park

Hiking trail in the Swiss National Park
Founded in 1914, Swiss National Park in the Engadine Valley is the oldest reserve in the Alps. The park sits right on the border with Italy and encompasses more than 170 square kilometers of flower-dotted hollows, fast-flowing rivers, and limestone crags. The scenery is especially dramatic in winter, when the forested mountains are covered in a blanket of snow, and the views from the cross-country ski trails are stunning.

Nature-lovers can explore the region on the large network of trails, though veering off these paths is forbidden in an effort to preserve the natural ecosystems. More than 5,000 species of wildlife call the park home, including marmot, red deer, chamois, ibex, fox, and more than 100 species of birds.

13. The Albula/Bernina Railway Line

The Bernina Railway line
One of the very few railway lines in the world designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage listing, the Albula/Bernina line on the Rheatian Railways offers a majestic ride not to be missed. The route extends throughout the Albula and Bernina landscapes, covering 122 kilometers and winding through almost 200 bridges, the Graubünden mountains, and a number of tunnels and viaducts along the way.

A ride on this train means panoramic seats that overlook unspoiled mountain landscapes, including the Piz Bernina, the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps at just over 4,000 meters tall. The train operates all year long, and the views are just as magical in summer as they are in winter.

14. Oberhofen Castle

Oberhofen Castle
Right on the shore of Lake Thun and surrounded by a 2.5-hectare park, this 13th-century castle is one of the most breathtaking in Switzerland. Because Oberhofen Castle changed hands many times through the centuries, and new owners kept adding rooms to it, the result is a magical mix of many styles: Bernese Baroque-style buildings, Romantic style facades, and Prussian-inspired exotic new areas (including a library and a smoking room).

The castle also houses a living museum showcasing the times and lives of feudal societies that called the castle (and its surroundings) home from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

15. Swiss Grand Canyon

View over the Ruinaulta (Swiss Grand Canyon)
The Ruinaulta (also known as the "Swiss Grand Canyon") is a deep gorge surrounded by expansive meadows and forested cliffs. Located in Eastern Switzerland, it was created over 10,000 years ago—when the Ice Age Rhine Glacier retreated, it led to a chain of events that resulted in a massive rockslide in the Rhine Valley. As the Rhine river seeped through the rock walls, the gorge was filled with water.

Today, the Swiss Grand Canyon is not only one of the most beautiful areas in Switzerland, but also a preferred destination for hikers, bird-watchers, and nature lovers. It's possible to raft the rapids here between May and October, or rent a canoe or kayak for a gentler route with stunning views of the steep cliffs all around.

Add to Plan
Planning a trip to Switzerland but not sure what to do or where to go? We’ve got you covered with our ultimate guide to the top 12 things to do and beautiful places to visit in Switzerland.

Ski in the shadow of the Matterhorn
At the ski resort of Zermatt, you can wind your way down top-class slopes with excellent views of the iconic, tooth-shaped Matterhorn. For those not wanting to take to the snow, there are other ways to admire the Matterhorn. By heading to the summit of the Rothorn, a short 30 minute cable car journey away from Zermatt, you’ll be treated to a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountains.

Deep dive into the local culture
It really is all about the local culture in Switzerland. Its cantons are home to such a wide variety of traditions and festivals that you’ll often feel like you’ve ventured into another country. At Basler Fasnacht, you can join masked pipers and drummers marching through the streets of Basel at the rather anti-social hour of 4am. On Mount Rigi you can partake in some Swiss wrestling, or head to the canton of Valais for the annual Witches Downhill Race. There’s plenty on throughout the year to give you a glimpse into the oddities and eccentricities that Swiss culture has on offer and you’ll probably leave scratching your head in bewilderment.

Relax and enjoy the views on the GoldenPass Line
The GoldenPass Line is the scenic route through Switzerland and it offers the chance to glimpse some of the country’s best scenery. Slow and leisurely at around five and a half hours long, the journey takes you from Lucerne to Montreux (or vice-versa) through six Swiss cantons via three mountain passes (including the Brünig Pass) and landscapes complete with lakes, waterfalls and valleys dotted with typical Swiss chalets. The GoldenPass isn’t direct and you have to switch trains in Interlaken and Zweisimmen. Make sure your camera is fully charged as you’re going to want to snap plenty of pictures.

Take a train to Jungfraujoch the highest station in Europe
At 3,454 metres above sea level, the Jungfraujoch in the Bernese Oberland is the highest railway station in Europe. Taking a train to the Jungfraujoch is a sure way to admire the Swiss Alps in all their splendour. Travelling along the Kleine Scheidegg pass, it’s possible to see the dramatic peaks of the Eiger, Jungfrau and Mönch mountains on the way. From the summit at the Jungfraujoch you’ll see the 23 kilometre Great Aletsch glacier, the longest glacier in the Alps, stretching out before you.

Get in touch with nature at the Swiss National Park
The Swiss National Park, the Alps’ oldest national park founded in 1914 is located in the canton of Graubünden in eastern Switzerland. It’s a gateway to nature and covers over 170 square kilometres, with 80 kilometres of hiking trails allowing you to explore to your heart’s content. Ibexes, chamois, marmots, golden eagles and bearded cultures are just some of the permanent residents of the park that can be spotted from the trails. Conservation of the park has been incredibly successful, partly because it is forbidden to leave the trails, a rule that is worth remembering.

Discover the origins of the universe at CERN
CERN, on the outskirts of Geneva is something not to be missed. It’s not every day that you’ll get to see the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particular accelerator that stretches out in a 27 kilometre ring under Swiss and French territory. If the accelerator is on, for obvious reasons, it’s not possible to visit. But the Microcosm, the Globe and the fascinating “Universe of Particles” exhibition are worth visiting to learn about the people behind the LHC and its mind-stretching experiments. If you want to take a guided tour it’s best to book as far in advance as possible, as they can fill up quickly.

Take a hike in the Alps
Hiking in Switzerland is an experience you are likely never to forget. In its small area, Switzerland is packed with so many impressive trails, dramatic mountain peaks and quiet, out-of-the-way valleys to explore. Thanks to clearly signposted pathways and in the ski resort areas, numerous lifts and buses, it’s easy to navigate your way around. If you’re looking to go out and about for longer than a day or two, it’s a good idea to check out the Swiss Alpine Club which runs a series of huts dotted around the country for decent prices. There’s also an app with routes of 32 hikes around the country.

Learn languages
Switzerland’s 26 cantons speak four languages between them. In the west of the country towards Geneva, you can practice your French, or head south to the Mediterranean climes of Ticino to pick up some Italian. Towards the centre, north and east you’ll come across German and Swiss German, which are quite dissimilar. In the canton of Graubünden you’ll hear Romansh spoken regularly. Despite it being the national language of Switzerland, it’s not even in the top ten languages spoken in the country. So if you want to practice your language skills or pick up some new ones, there’s no better place than Switzerland where you can learn four without ever leaving the country.

Go wine tasting in Vaud
It may be better known for its cheese than its wine, but Switzerland is also a top destination to sample some fine wines. You won’t find many of these wines elsewhere, as only a small margin is exported. The perfect time and place to try out Swiss wines is the caves ouvertes in early summer, where you pay a small price for a glass and can taste as much as you like. The canton of Vaud is one of the best places for wine tasting and the Lavaux vineyards in particular, a 12-kilometre stretch of vineyards that are just waiting to be explored. With a great atmosphere, clean mountain air and spectacular scenery all around, it’s an experience not to be missed.

Learn the art of cheese-making in Gruyères
Whether you fancy your cheese melted in a fondue or raclette or want the raw deal, Switzerland’s cheese won’t leave you disappointed. Le Gruyère is arguably the most popular and most famous of the Swiss cheeses. At the medieval town of Gruyères, you can discover the art of cheese-making in La Maison du Gruyère and afterwards try some out for yourself, melted or otherwise. The town’s cobbled streets are also pleasant to explore and to allow yourself to make some room for the traditional meringue and rich Gruyère cream, another speciality of the region.

Taste some of the world’s best Swiss chocolate
Train to become a maître chocolatier in Kilchberg, visit Maison Cailler in Broc, one of the world’s oldest chocolate factories and explore Zurich and learn the story of Lindt chocolate. All of this and more is possible in Switzerland, the home to some of the world’s finest chocolate treats.

Step back in time at the Château Chillon
Switzerland is home to many historic castles, but perhaps no others have such a beautiful setting as the Château Chillon. Perched on a small rocky island, the castle sits atop Lake Geneva with commanding views of the surrounding mountain ranges, like something out of a fairy tale. It’s the most visited historical building in all of Switzerland and you’ll likely spend several hours wandering through its bedrooms, courtyards and dungeons or just admiring the views.

Take a Hike on the Zermatt Lake Trail
With thousands of miles of well-marked trails, Switzerland is a mecca for hikers of all abilities. Stroll in the shadow of the iconic Matterhorn on the Zermatt Lake Trail, take in the country’s history on the Swiss Path along Lake Luzern, or spot native animals like the ibex or marmot hiking through Swiss National Park in Graubunden. Switzerland Tourism offers a free iphone app that details 32 of the country’s routes. Tip: walking poles and sturdy hiking boots help prevent twisted ankles and knee injuries from uneven ground.

Learn Some Languages
Switzerland packs a linguistic punch for a country its size. Travel between four distinct cultural regions without crossing a border and speak French in the west, Italian in the south, German in the northern and central parts of the country, and Romansh in Graubunden, in the east, where there’s an enclave of the traditional language. Most Swiss speak English as well, but greeting people with the appropriate local term—bonjour, boungiorno, or gruezi (Swiss German)—will get you far.

Join a Local Festival Like the Marches Folkloriques
Visitors can easily experience local traditions and national pastimes. Every Saturday from mid-July through August, the Marches Folkloriques in Vevey features Swiss folk music, alphorn performances, crafts, and wine tastings. During the Foire de Martigny in Valais, check out Swiss wrestling, flag or stone hurling, or Hornussen (like golf and baseball in one). Or head to Appenzell on the last Sunday in April to watch the open-air elections in the town square.

Retreat to the Quaint Villages of Chateau d’Oex, Wengen, Murren, and Others
If you want to slow down and unwind, ditch the city and head to one of Switzerland’s smaller towns. Chateau d’Oex, a peaceful resort in the Lake Geneva region, is a great base for outdoor or hot air balloon enthusiasts. Wengen and Murren, two villages perched overlooking the Lauterbrunnen Valley offer access to the Bernese Oberland peaks without the crowds of Interlaken. And quiet Gandria, on the shore of Lake Lugano, has winding alleys and Italian flair.

Get to Know the Cows in Gruyeres or Appenzell
Odds are when you travel to Switzerland, you’ll have some sort of interaction with cows—from the production of cheese to hearing the clank of cowbells in the countryside. Get to know the cows on a hike or a dairy farm tour near Chateau D’Oex. Or join the seasonal processions in Gruyeres or Appenzell when cows are led to and from the hills to graze. In fall, Martigny’s cow fights are popular events—cows lock horns but don’t hurt one another.

Take to Lake Geneva
Switzerland’s mountains hog the spotlight, but the country’s lakes are equally awe-inspiring. Glacial blue waters and shoreline vineyards create great photo ops, and locally sourced fish are a specialty on many menus. Cruise by the cascading Jet d’Eau and imposing Chateau de Chillon on Lake Geneva, ride a historic paddle steamer past the Rutli Meadow and Wilhelm Tell Chapel on Lake Luzern, or cross the border into Italy on Lake Lugano. City slickers in Zurich cool off with a dip in Lake Zurich, and bird watchers flock to Lac Neuchatel.

Gorge on Cheese in Fribourg
Just because the Swiss only eat fondue in winter doesn’t mean you can’t indulge year-round. The best is in Fribourg, where Gruyere and Vacherin Fribourgeois cheeses are melted together with white wine, garlic, and kirsch (cherry brandy). Other cheese dishes to try include raclette and alpen magronen (alpine macaroni and cheese). But also be sure to sample local regional varieties such as Sbrinz in Central Switzerland, Emmental in Bern, or Bundner Bergkase in Graubunden.

See Contemporary Art in Gruyeres or Basel
Home to some fantastic classical collections, Switzerland is also a top spot for cutting-edge contemporary art. Gruyeres, a medieval village best known for its cheese, is a surprising art hub—stroll around the chateau to see modern works inside a 13th century castle, or pop in the nearby Giger Museum and bar to see alien-like designs by H.R. Giger. In June, Basel hosts the glamorous Art Basel festival; check out the Kunsthalle and Carnival Fountain while you’re here. For serious art buffs, a trip to the spectacular Beyeler Foundation, 20 minutes from Basel, is not to be missed.

Sip Local Wines in Lake Geneva, Ticino or Valais
Whether it’s white wine made from Chasselas grapes on the shores of Lake Geneva, Merlot from Ticino, or Pinot Noir from the Valais, take advantage of the chance to savor local labels. Most Swiss wine is not exported so it’s hard to get outside of the country, but that doesn’t mean the quality is lacking. In Vaud, take a walk through the protected Lavaux vineyards—the views of Lake Geneva from the steep terraces are breathtaking.

Reach Great Heights at Piz Gloria
Vistas from Switzerland’s summits are spectacular, and you don’t need to be a climber to enjoy them. Cable cars, funiculars, and trains whisk you up thousands of feet to viewing stations and mountaintop restaurants. Visit a James Bond villain’s lair at Piz Gloria, an eatery atop Mt. Schilthorn, breathe in the chilly air on the Sphinx Terrace on the Jungfraujoch, or ride the world’s steepest cog railway to the top of Mt. Pilatus near Luzern.

Indulge in Chocolate at Nestle’s Callier Factory
Once you try really good Swiss chocolate, it’s hard to go back. This is where milk chocolate was invented (you can thank the cows for that), and chocolate-making is as much an art as it is a business. Satisfy your sweet tooth on a tour of Nestle’s Callier factory, or pick up some tasty bites as gifts or souvenirs. Our favorite shops are Sprungli and Teuscher in Zurich, Martel in Geneva, and Poyet in Vevey.

Take a Scenic Train Ride Aboard the Glacier Express
With 46 railway companies, more than 5,000 km (3,100 mi) of track, and a transportation system that’s rarely delayed, taking the train is the best way to get around Switzerland. Views from most trains will have you reaching for your camera, but for visually-stunning extras try one of the dedicated scenic routes, like the Glacier Express or Bernina Express, which often have panoramic windows and travel at slower speeds to let you soak in the sights.

Home  Europe  Switzerland
Here is a guest post from Roger for all the things to do in Switzerland. We love to host guest posts from people who love the country they live in.

Switzerland is a fabled land of mountains, chocolate, watches, and money. And if you ever travel there you will find that all of those are true.

But what most people don’t know is that there is an endless amount of unique experiences to be had too.

What are the Things to Do in Switzerland in 2020?
Anything from throwing yourself off a perfectly good dam to stuffing yourself with cheese til you (almost) can’t stand the sight of it anymore.

This Alpine wonderland has it all.

In this post, I am going to share 10 epic things to your travel bucket list for 2020.

Ready to roll? Let’s get started…

Ride A Train Through A Mountain To The Top Of Europe
10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
Jungfraujoch
You might have heard that the Swiss build a lot of tunnels.

After all, the country is filled with mountains, so, it’s either up and over, or plow through with a tunnel.

The Swiss do both with top-notch Engineering!

On top of these amazing everyday feats, the Swiss have also managed to build the highest train station in Europe: on the ​Jungfraujoch​.

And, to get to this stunning location you have to pass through a mountain, literally!

The Jungfraujoch sits just behind the infamous Eiger mountain right near Interlaken. And to get to it, these crazy guys built a tunnel right through the mountain.

Not only that, they created a few windows that peak out the front of the Eiger, and a stop at a glacier too.

For me, the Jungfraujoch, complete with its views of Switzerland’s longest glacier (the Aletsch) is a must-see and experience!

Shoot Through The Longest Tunnel In The World
Continuing on with the tunnels theme is the recent opening of the ​Gotthard Basis Tunnel connecting the North and South of Switzerland.

10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018

Unless you are a tunnel freak you may have missed all the news, but if you need to head South, it’s an amazing feat of engineering to check out from the comfort of your train:

Here are some Gotthard tunnel statistics to blow your mind:

The tunnel is 54 km (33.5 miles) long
It takes approximately 20 minutes for a train to pass through it
The train reaches speeds of 250 km/hr (155 miles/hr) on the very straight track
The journey between Zurich & Milan is now over 45 minutes shorter thanks to the tunnel
Any train heading from the North of Switzerland to the Italian part (or even Italy) will pass through it. Trains to Milan, Locarno, Lugano and anywhere in that region.

Just remember to be on the lookout for Erstfeld, the stop just before you head into the tunnel.

Jump Off The The Verzasca Dam (Like James Bond)
10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
Verzasca Dam – Image Courtesy of Wikipedia
Switzerland has a history of appearing in James Bond movies, and with all the mountainous scenery it’s really no surprise.

Mr. Bond has dodged wrongdoers on Swiss mountain passes.

Fought them on gondolas high above the valley floor However, the opening scene in the Golden Eye really took things to a new level.

Do you remember it? That scene where James Bond launches himself off the dam​ by doing a bungee jump right to the bottom.

Of course, he makes it look quite simple and not so scary, but my heart was in my throat for sure.

Well, guess what? You can do that too.

If you have the cajones! Just head down to the Verzasca valley in the south of Switzerland (via the Gotthard tunnel mentioned above) and ​sign yourself up!

It’s in a stunning area of Switzerland, a valley just outside of Locarno, where you can also do the canyoning I will mention in the next section.

So, even if you don’t intend on throwing yourself off a dam, it’s a stunning view nonetheless.

Slide Your Way Downstream
When all that snow in the Swiss Alps melts, it creates some stunningly blue and fast-running rivers.

And to make the best use of this, some creative Swiss tour operators have come up with a crazy activity called: Canyoning.

Canyoning involves squeezing yourself into a wetsuit, then throwing yourself down a river, often off waterfalls, to create one heck of an experience.

10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
Verzasca Valley
There are a number of places you can do this including ​the Verzasca Valley​ (if you are doing the Bungee off the dam you can do both in one day) or Interlaken (where the Jungfraujoch is).

So, you can usually combine a few things in one region.

Take A Helicopter Ride Over The Alps
Sure, there are helicopter rides everywhere around the world, but none quite like the one I took last year in Zermatt.

10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
Zermatt on its own is worth a visit.

It is a car-less town, right in the heart of the alps, that is as quaint as any alpine town can be. And, to top it all off, it is surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the Alps, including the iconic and pointy Matterhorn.

Now, imagine this stunning setting, but instead, from above.

That is what Air Zermatt can do for you. I recommend taking the 30min scenic ride, which quite honestly, will blow your mind.

They flew us over glaciers (I thought we were going “into it” at one point) within touching distance of the top of the Matterhorn (unless you are a climber, you will never see this view) and countless other highlights.

Sure, it’s expensive, but you will never doing anything like it.

Discover What All The Fuss Is About Watch Making
Switzerland is just a little bit famous for watches. You know, Rolex, Omega, Tissot, Breitling, Rado and little ol’ Swatch!

And, there are countless more (but I won’t bore you).

10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
Why not take a little time out on your trip to dive deep into watchmaking history, culture and technology and see what all the fuss is about.

You will be surprised how complex, minute, insanely time-consuming and drama-ridden this industry can be.

Depending on which part of Switzerland you find yourself in, there are countless opportunities to visit one of the watch manufacturer’s museums​ or public collections.

It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Swiss watchmaking at its best.

Eat Yourself To A Chocolate Death
10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
You know chocolate is good for you, right?

And when you are in the home of chocolate you absolutely have to immerse yourself in at least one chocolate experience.

Here are a couple of ideas for you: If you are in the French part of Switzerland, I recommend heading to ​the Callier Chocolate factory​ for a tour you won’t forget.

You can also combine it with a trip to Gruyere, home of Switzerland’s tastiest cheese (no, not that “hole-filled” Swiss cheese you probably know, this is even better!).

Or you can simply visit some of the local chocolate shops in both Zurich and Geneva, and even throw in a trip to the Lindt factory outlet store in Kilchberg outside Zurich.

Soak Up Some Liquid Cheese, With Bread
10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
You can’t leave Switzerland without trying at least one Cheese Fondue and many Swiss capitals have great restaurants that can help you with that bucket list item.

However, if you want to take it to the next level, why not immerse yourself in a ​fondue experience while riding a historic tram​.

Zurich has one such trip on offer, where you can not only get your fill of fondue but also see the sights at the same time.

If you have ever ridden those tour buses in big cities, this is just like that but way better. You get wined, dined and all from the inside of a historic Zurich tram.

Ignite Your Passion For Aliens, In Switzerland
10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
Giger Alien themed Museum – Image courtesy Doggettx ​
Who hasn’t seen at least one of the Alien movies? Hands up! And who hasn’t lain awake afterward, wondering if that funny feeling in your stomach isn’t an alien growing inside you? Let’s move on.

Well, the creator of those disgustingly scary aliens in those movies, along with many of the backdrops, was H. R. Giger, a Swiss local.

So, while you are here you can ​visit his museum which is conveniently located in the stunning town of Gruyere.

This is a historic town at the top of a hill, complete with a town square, wall, and castle.

Giger bought a few of the old buildings and made his art museum, as well as an Alien-themed bar.

So, after taking in all his warped ideas in the museum (including a gun loaded with bullet-people) you can also have a drink in his Alien-themed bar, right next door.

You will never get an experience quite like sipping a gin and tonic while surrounded by aliens, literally! Everything is Alien-themed in this bar including the walls, chairs, bar and some rather odd ideas in the restrooms.

It’s up to you if you want to visit, but it’s a once in a lifetime experience.

Relax In An Outdoor Spa In The Alps
After you have exhausted yourself with adrenaline-pumping activities and filled yourself with local Swiss food, it’s time to relax.

There is no better way to do that than in a designer Swiss spa right in the heart of the Alps.

Surround yourself with snow-capped peaks, fresh mountain air and perhaps even the sound of bells jingling on distant cows grazing.

One of my favorites, that is definitely not going to blow the budget, is ​Rigi Kaltbad​.

10 Unique Things To Do in Switzerland in 2018
View from Rigi Kaltbad
It’s a super modern spa designed by one of Switzerland’s most famous spa designers (yes, there is such a thing) that also has stunning views over Lake Lucerne and the mountains in the region.

You should combine it with a day trip and boat road from Lucerne. You can take the boat from the shore of the lake downtown, right to the gondola in Weggis.

From there, take the gondola to the top and land right at the front door of the spa. All you need to do is bring your swimsuit, and some warm clothes for the boat ride back!

What is the Best Time to Visit Switzerland?
Depending on the things you want to do in Switzerland, the season to visit varies.

Weather varies extremely too, so you need to plan carefully.

Do avoid borderline travel. This means that it may heavily snow during early spring and/or late fall.

Important notes:

Make sure you book ahead for Switzerland
Check flights as soon as possible
If you plan to get there by train then check this website
Always use travel insurance
Check a really interesting range of more than 350 tours
Spring: Spring is really green with all the flowers and trees blooming. However, if you plan for high alpine hiking then even May is early enough.

Summer: Summer and especially June is the time where hiking experiences start. July and August are the high peak months for visitors.

Autumn: September and October are great for outdoor activities. Less busy hiking trails and nights are slightly cold, while day time is sunny. Keep in mind that mist and fog start creeping in many valleys.

Winter: Snow and cold. Ski areas may not be open all the time. It depends on the severity of the weather. Christmas to January is rather busy when it comes to ski resorts.

That’s 10 Epic Experiences
Phew! That’s 10 epic and unique experiences. Switzerland certainly does have the scenery, location and adventure activities to keep absolutely anyone entertained for months on end.

All you have to do is make it your next travel destination and the rest will take care of itself.

I hope you found at least one one adventure to suit your tastes and have already noted it down for your bucket list.

See you soon, in Switzerland!

SWITZERLAND TRAVEL GUIDE
Last Updated: August 31, 2020

the Matterhorn with purple flowers in bloom, Switzerland
As one of the most expensive countries in Europe, Switzerland is often skipped over by budget travelers.

Visiting Switzerland is not cheaper. Before you even get out of the train station/airport, you’ll begin to wonder “how the heck did I spend so much money already?!”

Even when I was backpacking Switzerland, I found myself constantly trying to find ways to save money.

Yet, while it is not a cheap destination, Switzerland is one of the most beautiful places on earth.

The country is home to shimmering lakes, picturesque mountains (hello Alps!), tiny walled medieval towns, soaring peaks, endless green fields you want to run through, delicious chocolate, icnredible beer, and friendly, welcoming people.

Everything runs on time here, the country is safe, and everyone is super nice. I loved my time traveling around Switzerland.

The country rocks no matter what time of the year you visit (summer hiking, winter skiing).

To help lower your costs, use this travel guide to Switzerland to help you plan your trip and save money!

Top 5 Things to See and Do in Switzerland
aerial view over Bern, with the cathedral tower
1. Visit the capital, BernBern has an amazing historic town center that you’ll want to walk around all day long. This part of town is filled with medieval clocktowers, cobblestone streets, churches, and well-preserved sandstone homes. Be sure to walk the River Aare way, visit the History Museum and the Einstein Museum, and check out the bears at the Bear Park!

2. Ski the MatterhornThe Matterhorn’s sharp angular peak is one of Switzerland’s most iconic attractions. You’ll have to take a train or bus into the Zermatt area (the closest town to the mountain) as cars aren’t allowed. Not only do you need to ski here, but you can come to admire what’s truly a pollutant-free area. And, if you miss ski season, come hike the mountain in the summer.

3. Visit ZurichZürich is also set on beautiful Zurich Lake, near the mountains, and is close to a lot of other cities (like Bern). I love the historic center that opens up on the lake – a perfect day is sitting in the parks, and drinking a beer on the lakefront. The city is also very arty and full of street art and museums.
snow-capped mountains in Interlaken, Switzerland
4. Be adventurous in InterlakenInterlaken is one of the outdoor capitals of the country (though it’s quite touristy during peak season). There is a lot to do here for the adrenaline-seeker: skydiving over a Swiss glacier, water-skiing, skiing, hiking, etc. This is also ground zero for backpackers since there are so many free outdoor activities.

5. Visit the Swiss RivieraThe “Swiss Riviera” is situated in Lavaux (Cantan of Vaud) and goes along Lake Geneva. You can visit unique terraced vineyards that overlook the lake, the 12th-century castle Château de Chillon built on the water, and the town of Montreux, which is famous for its annual jazz festival.
Other Things to See and Do in Switzerland
1. Join in the Fasnacht Spring Carnival
This festival in Basel is a three-day party that welcomes in the warm weather and takes place annually on the Monday following Ash Wednesday. It’s something that’s highly anticipated by both tourists and locals, and it’s definitely Switzerland’s most popular festival. Fasnächtlers dress in elaborate costumes to hide their identities and parade around town with “cliques” (bands playing basler drums and piccolos). All the bars and restaurants in town remain open throughout the entire three days. Everyone here is in a good mood!

2. Explore Geneva
As the third largest city in Switzerland, Geneva offers spectacular views of the city’s lake (Lake Geneva), the world’s largest fountain, the UN, a historic city center, and a collection of international restaurants to satisfy anyone’s palate (thanks to the UN buildings in town). While you’re here make sure you check out the Geneva’s Art and History Museum or the Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum. There are 40 museums here in total!

3. Hike Mt. Pilatus
Located right outside the city of Lucerne, this beautiful mountain has breathtaking views of the alps. From the city, you can take a cable car to the top or (better yet) hike its trails to the top to look out over the Swiss Alps. There are some easier trails around the northern side of Pilatus, as well as other attractions in the summer months such as a ropes course.

4. Picnic at the Rhine Falls
Pack a picnic lunch and look out at your view of Europe’s largest waterfall. If you hop on a boat tour you can get extra close to the giant rock in the middle of the falls, and you’ll also experience the Rhine Falls Basin. Nearby in the town of Schaffhausen, you’ll find a medieval castle which also houses a hostel for cheap but interesting accommodations.

5. Explore St. Gallen
The seventh largest city in Switzerland, St. Gallen boasts beautiful museums, colorful murals, and one-of-a-kind architecture. It doesn’t receive as much tourist traffic as the other cities and regions around the country, but it’s a fun town full of students and you’re likely to befriend a few locals during your visit. Must-do: visit the Baroque cathedral and the Abbey Library, which is home to nearly 170,000 documents. Some are hand-written and over a thousand years old!

6. Visit the Old Villages
Visit the Graubunden area of the country, where you’ll find villages with houses dating back to the 13th century. Here they also speak an ancient language called Romanch, which has died out everywhere else in the country and the locals take great pride in keeping the tradition alive. Of course, it’s a haven for nature lovers – there are 615 lakes and 150 valleys in the region. Visiting here is a true Swiss Alpine experience.

7. Have a romantic time in Montreux
With a picturesque castle (Chateau de Chillo) lying at the edge of a lake, this area makes for a pretty romantic destination. Tour the castle, which dates all the way back to the 12th century and inspired the likes of Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, and more. The town was also the home of Freddie Mercury and there is a statue here in his honor. It costs 12.50 CHF ($12.55 USD) to visit the castle.

8. Discover rural culture in Appenzell
This small village of 7,000 lies in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden. There are no cars and the village has upheld much of its local traditions and culture, including dance and folk music. It’s an incredibly picturesque little town, with frescoed buildings and narrow alleyways. Its location near the foot of the Alpstein mountains makes it a great gateway for participating in summer and winter outdoor activities, like hiking and skiing. Take the Appenzell Railway to Wasserauen, and explore the fascinating prehistoric Wildkirchli caves (inhabited around 40,000 years ago).

9. Visit Lucerne
You can’t get much more of a typical Swiss destination than Lucerne. Located on the beautiful Lucerne Lake, the city offers a wonderful combination of urban life and nature. Spend some time in the old town, especially Weinmarkt, surrounded by medieval guildhalls and decorative buildings. Cross Chapel Bridge, the world’s oldest surviving truss bridge, and pay attention to the 17th-century ceiling paintings showing events from Lucerne’s history.

Switzerland Travel Costs
Accommodation – Hostel dorms average 30 CHF ($30 USD) per night, but in some major cities, they can run as high 50 CHF ($50 USD). Private hostels rooms range from 80-120 CHF ($81-121 USD) a night for rooms that sleep two. Most hostels offer free linens, WiFi, and some include breakfast. Hotels are super expensive. You should expect to spend between 90-120 CHF ($90-121 USD) per night for the most basic of rooms. For something a little nice and more spacious, look closer to 150-200 CHF ($151-202 USD) per night. A much better alternative to hotels is Airbnb, where a shared room in someone’s house typically costs 30 CHF ($30 USD) a night and an entire apartment is about 60 CHF ($60 USD).

Food – Although eating out is very pricey (as an easy comparison: Starbucks coffee is 8 CHF/$8 USD while McDonald’s is 15 CHF/$15 USD), you can keep your spending in check by going to the local supermarkets and buying your own groceries. You’ll spend around 130 CHF ($131 USD) per week for basics like pasta, sandwich ingredients, sauce, rice, eggs, and fruits and vegetables. Supermarkets also sell pre-made meals for between 5-9 CHF ($5-9 USD). Bars and cafés are the cheapest food option, cost about 9-15 CHF ($9-15 USD) for a lunch special. Restaurants with table service are around 20 CHF ($20 USD) for lunch and 40 CHF ($40 USD) for dinner (starter, main, and drink) to start (prices go up from there and I saw some Italian restaurants asking 35 CHF ($35 USD) per main course!! That’s expensive pasta!). You’ll typically find pizzas for around 20 CHF ($20 USD) in a restaurant. If you’re dining out (but still trying to stick to a budget), you’ll spend an average of 45 CHF ($45 USD) a day on food. From there, the sky is the limit! For people who want to cook and eat the occasional meal out, expect to spend around 20 CHF ($20 USD) per day.

Activities – Most museums cost around 10 CHF ($10 USD) to enter (if you are a student, you’ll save 2-4 CHF ($2-4 USD) off the price of your admission (be sure to have your student ID with you). All day hiking excursions or adventure activities begin around 70 CHF ($70 USD). Paragliding costs about 160 CHF ($161 USD) and a bit more in the winter. Ski and snowboard lift tickets can cost anywhere from 27-75 CHF ($27-75 USD) per day (depending on the mountain), and 6-day passes cost 4-5 times the price of the daily pass, so if you’re staying for a while, buy that.

Backpacking Switzerland Suggested Budgets
For those backpacking through Switzerland, budget at least 70-108 CHF ($70-110 USD) per day. This is a suggested budget assuming you’re staying in a hostel, cooking most of your meals or eating fast food, and using local transportation or mostly walking. This is also assuming you’re enjoying plenty of free nature, or an occasional museum.

If you Couchsurf, cook all your food, and rideshare, you could probably do the country between $50-70 USD per day. It would be a tight budget but it would be doable.

For a mid-range budget of 230-270 CHF ($235-275 USD) per day, you’ll get to eat mostly fast food meals, stay in private hostel rooms, do some intercity trips, and opt for a few outdoor excursions or other attractions.

For a luxury budget of 490+ CHF ($500+ USD) per day, you can afford to eat out at restaurants, stay in nice hostels, have more flexibility with intercity travel, and enjoy more expensive activities (like multi-day ski passes or tours).

Switzerland Travel Guide: Money Saving Tips
Switzerland is a very expensive country. There’s no hiding that fact. But there are plenty of ways to save money in the country so you don’t go bankrupt while visiting. Here are some helpful, high value ways I lowered my costs:

Have an ISIC Card – To save 20-50% on the cost of admission to museums and other tourist attractions, be sure to present a valid student card. The ISIC is typically accepted in places where a foreign student ID is not.
Use Couchsurfing – It’s a service that lets travelers stay with locals for free. It was a lifesaver that allowed me to keep my costs down the most. Since a lot of travelers use this service, make your requests for hosts early.
Use BlaBlaCar – Transportation is very expensive, even more so than accommodation. Most intercity trains are around 50 CHF ($50 USD). That adds up too quickly! Instead, use the ride-sharing website BlaBlaCar to avoid the trains and meet locals. A word of caution: Be advised that many rides cancel. I had three rides cancel on me at the last minute (and one guy who just failed to even show up), so the service requires some flexibility. But when it works, it’s awesome.
Use hotel points – Hotel reward points are a lifesaver in an expensive destination, where even hostels are expensive and the chance of getting a Couchsurfing host is small. Rack up a few hotel points by travel hacking before your trip and burn them while you stay in the country. Most hotel sign-up bonuses are around 60,000 points, which is worth about five nights at the chain hotels like Hilton, Marriott, or Starwood (just make sure you stay at their cheaper properties. Sorry, no W for you!).
Don’t drink – Drinking is not cheap here. Most beers are around 8 CHF ($8 USD). (Plus, who wants to hike while hung over?) Most wines are between 10-25 CHF ($10-25 USD) a bottle. If you must drink, stick to hostel bars where you can enjoy 2-for-1 happy hours and cheap drinks for around 5 CHF ($5 USD) or buy your beers at grocery stores for as little was 2 CHF ($2 USD).
Cook – With sit-down restaurants costing around 40 CHF ($40 USD) per meal per person, eating out in Switzerland can be very costly, so buy your groceries. A week’s worth of food (bread, pasta, rice, eggs, vegetables, cheese, deli meats for sandwiches, and some assorted fruit) will cost you 75-100 CHF ($75-101 USD). The major supermarkets are Migros, COOP, and Spar. COOP is the most expensive.
Go veggie – Meat is expensive in Switzerland. Every Swiss resident or expat I talked to told me about how they limit their meat consumption because it costs so much. Stick to veggies and avoid buying meat for your meals (especially beef). While I was trolling supermarkets and butchers for grocery prices (travel writing is glamorous, huh?!), I found a pound of meat was 12-14 CHF ($12-14 USD). At that price, stick to deli meats for protein!
Use lunch specials – If you are going to eat out, do so during lunch when most lunch specials at cafes and restaurants cost around 10-19 CHF ($10-19 USD). Moreover, stick to the ethnic restaurants like Chinese, Middle Eastern, Indian, or Thai for the best deals and biggest portions (and closer to that 10 CHF/$10 USD price). Lunch specials are a great way to get a lot of bang for your buck and to enjoy the dinner menu but at a cheaper set menu price.
Bring a refillable water bottle – At 2-4 CHF ($2-4 USD) a bottle, that’s a lot of money spent on water after a few days. The water in Basel is safe to drink, so refill your bottle before you go out to save money.
Book your trains early – While a train ride is a cheaper way to travel than the plane, you can get even cheaper rates by booking your train ticket early. Swiss Rail also offers one-day and weekend group passes to look into.
Where To Stay in Switzerland
Hostels are the way to go in Switzerland! Fortunately there are plenty of clean, well-maintained hostels around. My suggested places are:

Balmers (Interlaken)
Funny Farm (Interlaken)
(Zurich)
(Zurich)
(Geneva)
(Geneva)
(Bern)

How to Get Around Switzerland
Public Transportation – Cities and towns in Switzerland are incredibly well connected with trams, buses, funiculars, trains, etc. Each mode of transportation is safe, clean, and reliable. A single fare will usually cost between 2.50-5 CHF ($2.50-5 USD) depending on the length of time and number of zones you travel.

Uber is available in Basel, Geneva, and Zurich. Otherwise, taxi fare is expensive!

The larger cities also have excellent public bike sharing and car sharing programs. PubliBike and Mobility let you rent bikes and cars via their app, starting at around 4.50 CH per 30 minutes for bicycles and 0.55 CH per kilometer for car rentals.

You should consider getting a Swiss Half Fare Card. It will allow you to travel by train, bus, boat, and most mountain railways at half the price for one full month, and it only costs 120 CHF ($121 USD). This will only be cost effective if you intend to spend more than 240 CHF ($242 USD) on public transportation.

If you’re staying awhile and plan on cramming a LOT into your itinerary, you might want to look into getting a Swiss Travel Pass. It’s steep in price – ranging from 225 CH ($227 USD) for 3 consecutive days to 485 CH ($490 USD) for 15 consecutive days (there are non-consecutive passes as well) – but it could be worth your time. It covers all public transit (train, boat, bus), free travel on panorama trains, admission to 500 museums, mountain excursions, and more. The card will also hold your Mobility and PubliBike memberships, and any MobilSki passes for the resorts.

If you’re considering the Swiss Half Fare Card or the Swiss Travel Pass, use the sbb.ch website to figure out the full fares for some of the trips you plan to make. This is the best way to figure out if either card is cost effective for you.

Train – Train is the best way to travel in Switzerland, and is the most preferred method for locals. It’s economical and efficient. For example, Bern to Geneva (a two-hour train) costs around 30 CHF ($30 USD). A two-hour trip from Zurich to Interlaken is about 35 CH ($35 USD), while a 1.5 hour trip from Zurich to Bern is around 25 CH ($25 USD). Expect to pay anywhere between 30-50 CHF ($30-50 USD) for a second-class train ticket between cities.
As mentioned above, if you plan on doing a lot of train travel, consider the Swiss Travel Pass or the Half Fare Card.

Bus – Flixbus offers a few routes around the country. A 90-minute ride from Zurich to Bern starts at 13 CH ($13 USD), while a 5-hour journey from Zurich to Geneva starts at 26 CH ($26 USD).

Flying – The country is so tiny, there’s no need to fly. It’s expensive and not worth the hassle. Take the train or bus!

Ridesharing – Using a ridesharing service like BlaBlaCar is one of the best ways to get around the country, although it does require some flexibility! It lets you share rides with vetted local drivers by pitching in for gas. You simply request a seat, they approve, and off you go! It’s a cheaper and more interesting way travel than by bus or train!

Hitchhiking – Hitchhiking in Switzerland is a great way to get around, although it’s legal to hitchhike on motorways (it’s fine to do at gas stations though). It’s a common practice in the mountain regions and country areas, where public transit isn’t as readily available. Hitchwiki.org is a great resource.

When to Go to Switzerland
The right time to visit Switzerland depends entirely on what you’d like to do. Are you planning a ski trip? Sampling all the chocolate? Hiking the Alps?

Most visitors come in the summer season, from May to September (although in the mountains temperatures don’t really start warming up until June). July and August has the warmest temperatures, with snow-free hiking trails and longer days. If you’re around on August 1st, you’ll witness tons of celebrations for Swiss National Day (fireworks!). Peak temperatures are 65°-82°F (18 to 28 °C), with almost no humidity.

The shoulder seasons are from around April to early May and late October to the end of November, which is known in Switzerland as Zwischenzeit – the “between time” for the ski and summer seasons. It’s a good time for city hopping, but the ski resort towns are completely quiet and a lot of things are closed. The weather can also be unpredictable.

Ski season is from December to March, where resort towns get crowded and very expensive! If you’re a skier, that probably won’t matter much – Switzerland has some of the best skiing in the world. Conversely, cities like Zurich are quieter as everyone flocks to the mountains. The weather is cold – averaging 28°-45°F (-2-7°C) daily – so be sure to pack plenty of layers.

How to Stay Safe in Switzerland
Switzerland is one of the safest countries in the world, including for solo travelers and solo female travelers. The most common type of crime is pickpocketing in tourist-heavy areas. In some cities, like Geneva, petty crime is on the rise.

If you’re traveling in the mountains, keep an eye on weather reports and forecasts. The weather can be extreme! If you’re prone to altitude sickness you will also want to prepare accordingly.

You can read about the 14 travel scams to avoid right here.

Always trust your gut instinct. If a taxi driver seems shady, stop the cab and get out. If your hotel is seedier than you thought, get out of there. Make copies of your personal documents, including your passport and ID.

If you don’t do it at home, don’t do it in Switzerland!

The most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel insurance. Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. You can use the widget below to find the policy right for you:

1. The Matterhorn
This pyramid-shaped giant is one of the world’s most photographed mountains, which means it’s definitely a top place to visit in Switzerland. Standing at an impressive 4,478 meters, thrill-seeking mountaineers from around the globe descend on Switzerland to attempt the summit. If you’re not feeling quite so energetic, why not stick to the cable car? The mountain is home to the highest cable car station in the Alp, which offers some excellent views of the mountain peak and beyond. It really doesn’t get much more Swiss than a trip to the Matterhorn.

2. Château de Chillon
No trip to the Swiss Riviera is complete without checking out the medieval Château de Chillon. Located on an island in Lake Geneva near the popular town of Montreux, the castle dates back to the 10th century, when it was used as a strategic water fort. It then became a lakeside summer home for the wealthy Counts of Savoy, when the castle rooms were decked out with all manner of art and treasures visitors can enjoy today. The castle is Switzerland’s most-visited historical monument and is definitely a must-see while you’re exploring the country.

3. Jungfraujoch
The Jungfraujoch is an Alpine wonderland that fully deserves its nickname of the Top of Europe. Technically a glacier saddle between two mountains, the Jungfraujoch is one the best – and highest – attractions in Switzerland. And don’t let the altitude put you off – there’s plenty for the whole family up there, from mountain climbing to tobogganing and much more. However, perhaps the most impressive attraction is the world-famous Jungfrau railway. Starting at Kleine Scheidegg, the train climbs up to 3,454 meters above sea level to Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe.

4. Schweizerischer Nationalpark
In a country with amazing scenery at every turn, it can be hard to know where to go. But one thing for certain is that you’ll want to visit the Swiss National Par near Zernez. As the country’s only national park, it’ll give you an idea of how the Alps were before tourism. From snow-crusted glaciers to captivating meadows, this place has it all. There are plenty of hiking trails to choose from, each taking visitors past unforgettable sights. And, if you’re lucky you might catch sight of some of the park’s local residents – red squirrels, ibexes, and red deer all call this park home.

5. Lake Geneva
Stretching from Geneva in the west to Lausanne in the east, Lake Geneva is one of Switzerland’s most beautiful places. From the international bustle of Geneva to the many vineyards that crawl up the hillsides around the lake, there’s plenty to do in the surrounding region. And there’s a lot of activity on the lake, too. Windsurfing, water skiing, and kayaking are all possible for more active visitors to the area. Or, if you’re feeling a little lazier, you can simply sit back and take in the beauty of the lake from the deck of a paddle steamer as it crosses the water.

Not only is the medieval city of Bern Switzerland’s capital, but it’s also one of its most enchanting places to visit. Walk around the old town’s narrow cobblestone stones and you’ll soon realize just why the neighborhood is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. All across Bern’s historic center, you’ll find a whole host of boutiques, bars, and bears. Yes, that’s right, a family of bears – the city’s symbol – lives at the city’s aptly named Bear Park just across the river from the old town. If that wasn’t enough, the city hosts plenty of lively markets, including some memorable Christmas markets during Advent.

Wandering around the captivating old town, you’ll be forgiven for thinking you’ve stepped into a painting. There’s ancient churches, bustling squares and plenty of boutiques to explore as you marvel at the architectural wonder of the city. But the highlight is the Chapel Bridge, a covered wooden bridge that has been connecting the center of Lucerne since 1333.

As Europe’s most powerful waterfall, it’s easy to see why Rhine Falls is one of the top things to do in Switzerland. Visitors can take in the beauty of the waterfall – located near the northern town of Schaffhausen – from several viewing decks. If you’re feeling more adventurous, you can even rent a canoe and check out some nearby castles from the water. Every August, the falls host a spectacular firework display that attracts visitors from around the country as part of Switzerland’s National Day celebrations.

And last but not least, no list of the top things to do in Switzerland would be complete without mentioning Zurich. The largest Swiss city, Zurich is also the social and cultural hub of the country. In fact, despite its world-renowned financial offerings, Zurich has a surprisingly bustling social scene. From the popular Pride parade to Europe’s largest street rave, there’s a lot going on. And, if all that wasn’t enough, the city’s pretty easy on the eye – from the charming streets of the old town to the stunning scenery of Lake Zurich.

Summer travel: 26 things to do in Switzerland’s 26 cantons
The lovely town of St Ursanne in Switzerland's Jura canton. Photo: Photo: Ivo Scholz/Swiss Tourism
From Aargau to Zurich, we take a whistle-stop trip around the highlights for Switzerland's 26 cantons vising castles, lakes and mountains along the way.
Aargau: Lenzberg Castle

With a history dating back a thousand years, Aargau’s Lenzberg Castle is well worth a visit. Also known as the Dragon Castle, this 'Schloss' comes complete with its own dragon’s lair, a drawbridge, a knight’s hall and picnic-worthy gardens. A great day-trip, with a fantastic kids’ playroom where you can dress up as knights, ladies and dragons too, of course!
 
Appenzell Ausserrhoden: Säntis

The small half-cantons of Appenzell Ausserrhoden (traditionally Catholic) and Innerrhoden (traditionally Protestant) make up the picturesque region of Appenzellerland.
 
When visiting Ausserrhoden, you can’t go past (literally) its resident mountain, Säntis. An impressive peak reaching to 2,501m, Santis is the tallest mountain in the Alpstein massif. Catch a cable car (or hike) to the top and gaze out over neighbouring cantons Appenzell Innerrhoden and St Gallen or over Lake Constance.

It is said that on a clear day that you can see six countries from the top of the Säntis: Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Lichtenstein and Italy.
 
Plan B: Appenzell cheese factory
Sample one of Appenzellerland’s most famous local products with a trip to the Appenzell cheese factory and museum. 
 
Appenzell Innerrhoden: Berggasthaus Aescher
 

Photo: Aescher Alpstein
 
An Instagram staple, Berggasthaus Aescher gives new meaning to the term “destination restaurant” – even when that is not always positive news.
 
Located a cable-car ride and short hike from Wasserauen, Aescher is built right into the cliff face and clings dazzlingly to the side of the Ebenalp mountain (if you go inside, you’ll see the back wall of the hotel is actually living rock). It's open May to November.
 
Basel-Landschaft: Augusta Rurica
 

Photo: Suzanne Schenker
 
Soak up some of this canton’s ancient Roman history at Augusta Rurica, Switzerland’s largest archaeological park. The ruins from some of the earliest Roman settlements along the Rhine river include an amphitheatre, a castle and aqueduct. There’s also a museum containing the treasure of Kaiseraugst, one of the largest hoards of Roman silver ever discovered. 
 
Basel-Stadt: Fondation Beyeler
 

Photo: Stephan Schacher/Fondation Beyeler
 
Switzerland’s self-styled capital of culture hosts the famous international art fair Art Basel annually in June. However, if you can’t be there for those four days, do not despair! The city offers a wealth of high-profile art year-round.
 
Check out Fondation Beyeler, with its impressive exhibition schedule of classic modern and contemporary artists, and the permanent collection including Monet, Kandinsky, Picasso, Warhol, Matisse and Rothko. This year's summer exhibition is given over to contemporary painter Rudolf Stingel including works that has never before been shown.
 
Bern: the Old Town

The Swiss capital city’s Old Town (Altstadt) was declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1983 and it’s easy to see why. The charming medieval streets and well-preserved renaissance buildings are dramatically situated on and above the steep banks of the River Aare, which is where the city's residents go to cool off on hot summer afternoons.

Plan B: The Bernese Oberland 
It's less of a plan B and more of a must-do-as-well. The countryside around Bern has some world-class scenery. Check out the pretty, car-free town of Wengen with views to the 'big three' mountains: Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau or swim in the turquoise waters of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz.
 
Fribourg: Gruyères

The historic walled town of Gruyères offers many delights, from its famous cheese (honoured in the Maison du Gruyère where you can see it being made) to visiting the museum devoted to Swiss artist HR Giger.

This museum is home to the largest collection of the Alien designer’s dark, organic sci-fi sculptures, paintings, furniture and film designs. 
 
Plan B: Frog Museum
Another medieval town in canton Fribourg contains possibly the strangest museum in Switzerland. The Frog Museum in Estavayer-le-Lac features 108 stuffed frogs arranged in scenes from everyday life in the mid-19th century, thought to have been the taxidermy project of a former Swiss Guard. 
 
Geneva: the Jet d’Eau
 

Photo: Olivier Miche/Geneva Tourism
 
You can’t visit Geneva without checking out the Jet d’Eau waterspout. Built in 1886 to regulate the water pressure, it’s one of the world’s tallest fountains, reaching 140m at its highest spray. It spurts into Geneva harbour in front of Quai Gustave-Ador but you’ll get the best pics from the other side, near the Bains des Pâquis. 
 
Plan B: CERN
Science buffs won’t want to miss checking out the famous European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) while in Geneva. If you want to do a guided tour, book early as the English-language ones are highly sought-after.
 
Glarus: Klontalersee 
 

Photo: Bob Ryskamp
 
Nice things come in small packages. Switzerland’s smallest canton offers the gem of the Klontalersee – a pretty mountain lake with amazing reflections. Walk around the shores, taking snaps, or take a boat tour. You can even swim here in summer, when the water temperature reaches around 20C.

Graubünden: Swiss National Park
 

Photo: Caroline Bishop
 
In a country known for its natural beauty, it may surprise you to learn Switzerland only has one national park. But because it’s Switzerland, it’s a pretty spectacular one. Covering an area of 170 kilometres square in the wild and wonderful southeastern canton of Graubünden, this is a unique area of the Alps stocked full of flora and fauna. 
 
Plan B: Soglio
The traditional alpine hamlets of Graubünden are always winning ‘most picturesque village in the world’ awards, so stop in and visit one while you’re here: try tiny Soglio (pop: 167).
 
Jura: St Ursanne
 

Photo: Ivo Scholz/Swiss Tourism
 
On the other side of Switzerland, Jura offers up the gorgeous town of St Ursanne on the banks of the fast-flowing river Doubs. The town revolves around its handsome Collegiate Church and former monastery and still retains a peaceful, reflective feel. 
 
Plan B: Jurassic Jura
Those who want to put the Jurassic in Jura can explore the canton’s fantastic ‘Tracking the Giants’ dinosaur trail, where you’ll see fossil footprints and other relics of the area’s former prehistoric inhabitants.  
 
Lucerne: Chapel Bridge
 

Photo: Jan Geerk/Swiss Tourism
 
Lucerne (Luzern in German) is a must-see on any tourist’s list. The old town is stunningly situated on the banks of Lake Lucerne, over the waters of which stands the famous Kapellbrücke – a 14th-century covered wooden bridge featuring 17th century painted scenes of local history and the city’s patron saints. It was rebuilt in 1993 after a devastating fire which destroyed many of the original paintings.
 
Neuchâtel: Absinthe Museum
 

Photo: Caroline Bishop
 
The wormwood-infused "green fairy" drink beloved of Toulouse-Lautrec and co. in Paris during the Belle Époque was first concocted in Neuchâtel’s Val-de-Travers in the late 1700s.

Nowadays you can walk or cycle a 35km Absinthe Trail linking distilleries, restaurants and shops selling the stuff, and visit the fascinating Maison de l’Absinthe (Absinthe Museum) in Motiers. But be warned, you may start seeing double if you imbibe too much on the way!   
 
Nidwalden: Stanserhorn’s open-air cable car
 

Photo: Christian Perret/Swiss Tourism
 
Switzerland has some excellent cable cars, funiculars and cog-wheel railways with almost-unfailingly jaw-dropping ascents and nerve-inducing views. However, Nidwalden’s Stanserhorn CabriO has a little extra claim to fame – it’s the world’s first open-top, double-decker cable car (not for the faint of heart).
 
Enjoy brilliant 360 degree views from the top deck as you travel up the Stanserhorn mountain, plus the added thrill of feeling the wind in your hair.
 
Obwalden: Pilatus
 

Photo: Andreas Gerth/Swiss Tourism
 
Another record-breaking mountain ride is located in Obwalden. The astounding feat of engineering that is the Pilatusbahn winds its way up the side of Mount Pilatus and is the world’s steepest cog railway. Once you’re at the 2,132m station of Pilatus Kulm, you’ll enjoy wonderful views over Lake Lucerne and beyond.

Schaffhausen: Rheinfalls
 

Photo: Christof Sonderegger/Swiss Tourism
 
Getting sick of huge mountains and picturesque towns? In Schaffhausen the main attraction is the impressive Rheinfalls. Europe’s answer to Niagara, the sheer volume of Rhine River water pounding over these waterfalls is a sight to see – especially in spring and early summer as the mountain snow melts away.
 
Plan B: Stein Am Rhein
Just in case you were after another lovely town – Stein Am Rhein is a beautiful example, full of half-timbered, brightly painted medieval buildings. 
 
Schwyz: Einsiedeln Abbey
 

Photo: Christof Sonderegger/Swiss Tourism
 
The town of Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz is watched over by the large, baroque-style Einsiedeln Abbey and church.
 
This still-active Benedictine monastery was first established around 1,000 years ago and has been a popular resting spot on the 'Way of St James' pilgrimage route for much of that time. Lovely at any time of year, the Abbey is especially magical at Christmas when there’s a large market chock full of food, gifts and Glühwein (or mulled wine). 
 
Solothurn: Solothurn old town 
 

Photo: Claire Doble
 
Solothurn, something of a cultural hub with its literature and film festivals, is billed as Switzerland’s finest baroque town. The capital of the canton of the same name, the town centre is a beautifully maintained time capsule from the 17th century.
 
Take a tour to discover how Solothurn is centred around the mystical number 11, with 11 fountains, 11 abbeys and churches, and even a clock face with just 11 numbers on it. 
 
St. Gallen: Stiftsbibliothek Library 
 

Photo: Christof Schuerpf/Swiss Tourism
 
The entire St Gallen Abbey precinct is Unesco-listed, but the medieval jewel in the crown is the Abbey’s Stiftsbibliothek (library). This opulent wood-panelled space is one of the oldest libraries in the world still in operation. It contains a treasure trove of rare and ancient manuscripts including some of Charlemagne’s correspondence and priceless illuminated manuscripts dating from the early middle ages onward. 
 
Plan B: Mogelsberg treetop walk
This beautiful new walkway not far from the city of St Gallen rises up to 50 metres off the forest floor and allows people to experience the flora and fauna in a whole new way. Pram-friendly, it offers views over the Necker Valley and even as far off as the dramatic Churfirsten mountain range and the Appenzellerland region.

Thurgau: Sugar Mill tour
 
Sugar is big business in Switzerland and, given the amount of chocolate produced and consumed here, that probably won’t shock you. In the largely agricultural canton of Thurgau (it is famous for its apples and apple cider), you can get stuck into the nitty gritty of Swiss sugar production by taking a tour of one of the country’s main sugar mills in the cantonal capital city, Frauenfeld. 
 
Plan B: The Hüttwilersee 
This small tranquil lake is a hidden gem for hiking around or even diving into during the warmer months. 
 
Ticino: Bellinzona’s castles
 

Photo: Roland Gerth/Swiss Tourism
 
If you want sunshine, Switzerland's Italian-speaking canton of Ticino is a good bet. And a good place to start is the town of Bellinzona which is home to not one but three atmospheric ruined castles. These are Unesco-listed and offer a fine day’s exploration as well as some stunning views from the ancient ramparts. 
 
Plan B:  Lavertezzo bridge
The Lavertezzo bridge in Ticino’s stunning Verzasca Valley is a medieval, double-curved bridge that arcs over the pristine bottle-green water of the Verzasca river and is another postcard-perfect spot.
 
Uri: Rütli meadow 
 

Photo: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP
 
Uri is famous for not one but two Swiss 'origin stories'. It is where the arguably mythical character of William Tell lived and shot the arrow off his son’s head (there’s a bronze statue of him in Altdorf), and it’s also where you’ll find the Rütli meadow, where the oath of the Swiss Confederation was first sworn back in 1291 – at least according to the popular version.
 
Read also: Quiz - how well do you know these key dates in Swiss history?
 
A visit to Rütli is something akin to visiting the UK’s Runnymede or Independence Hall in the US. The spectacular boat ride across Lake Lucerne to the meadow is an experience in itself.
 
Valais: The Matterhorn
 

Photo: Toni Mohr/Swiss Tourism
 
It’s all about altitude in Valais. The canton is home to the stunning, instantly recognizable Matterhorn mountain, as well as around 45 other peaks that rise over 4,000 metres above sea level including Switzerland’s highest, Dufourspitze at 4,634m. 
 
Vaud: Vevey
 

 
The elegant town of Vevey is very much on the international travel radar in 2019 with both Lonely Planet and National Geographic putting on its 'must-see' lists for this year.
 
The reason is the upcoming Fête des Vignerons (Winegrowers' Festival), which runs from July 18th to August 11th.
This Unesco-recognised event is Switzerland's oldest and largest wine festival and – to make it even more special – it is held a maximum of five times every century.

Last staged in 1999, the Fête des Vignerons has its origins in the 17th century when the Wine Guild held a yearly pageant in Vevey, which is located at the foot of one of Switzerland's oldest wine-growing regions, the Lavaux.

 
Zug: Zug Town centre and lake

Zug has both new and old attractions. The Old Town of the canton capital (also named Zug) is very pleasant for a stroll – don’t miss the clock tower – and once you hit the shores of Lake Zug, you’ll spot the stylish, modern Roman Signer lake view sculpture, which you can enter for a duck’s eye view of Lake Zug.  
 
Zürich: Uetliberg 
 

The view from Zurich's Uetliberg. Photo: Christof Sonderegger/Swiss Tourism
 
Zurich’s ‘home mountain’ provides panoramic views across Switzerland’s largest city and its lake, all the way to the Alps in the distance on a clear day. 
 
Plan B: Swimming in Zurich
If the weather allows, go jump in the lake! There’s hundreds of spots to swim in the fresh, clear waters of Lake Zurich and its fast-flowing offshoot, the Limmat River.

The Matterhorn is one of the highest mountains in Switzerland, but it really stands out for its unique shape and role in mountaineering history. Standing at 4,478 meters tall (14,692 feet), this highly photographed mountain draws in alpinists from all over the world to summit to the top. It’s located near Zermatt, one of Europe’s most beautiful mountain towns, which is very pedestrian-friendly and a year-round destination for skiers and hikers. The best and most scenic way to get here is by train, and once you arrive, all vehicles in the city are required to be battery-operated. It’s also fun to take a cable car ride in Zermatt to get to the other mountains for skiing, snowboarding, and hiking.

Ride the Bernina Express Through the Swiss Alps
NEARBY HOTELS 
One of the most memorable things you’ll ever do in Switzerland, the Bernina Express takes you on a journey through the Swiss Alps. This train route will take you through alpine scenery, historical sites, and you’ll see amazing views around every turn. The route goes from the town of Chur in Switzerland to Tirano in Italy and crosses the canton of Graubünden on a ride that takes about four hours. Alternatively, you can take a route from Davos for a 15-minute ride or a ride from St. Moritz for about a two-hour ride. But the full route is definitely the best one to take if you have the time. The first section overlaps with a section of the Glacier Express Route, the second section offers views of the highest peaks in the region, and the third section offers views of the southern scenery along Lakes Lugano and Como via bus to Lugano.

Geneva is an international city that’s known for its role in the United Nations and the International Red Cross. But the city itself is also full of interesting attractions, including a collection of lovely parks. One of the best ways to get to know Geneva is to take a boat ride out on Lake Geneva and experience it from the water. This is one of the largest lakes on the continent, and it offers amazing views of the surrounding cities and towns, as well as the Alps and Jura mountain ranges, which are great for skiing and hiking depending, on the season. It’s also fun to explore the Vaud wineries because there are many vineyards that surround Lake Geneva.

Zurich is the largest city in Switzerland and is a favorite spot among art and culture enthusiasts. There are so many museums and art galleries here that it would be impossible to see them all in just one trip. One highly recommended thing to do in Zurich is to explore the Old Town area, known as Altstadt. This area is home to the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus Zürich (Museum of Art), the Fraumünster Church (Minister of Our Lady), and Bahnhofstrasse (shopping avenue). It’s also interesting to admire the unique architecture of the buildings here and experience the city’s hip nightlife scene. It’s easy to get to and from Old Town via city tram.

From exploring the top of Europe to sailing around Lake Geneva, photographing Chillon Castle or passing by the spectacular Rhine Falls on your Grand Train Tour, you’ll soon realise why Switzerland is known to be one of the most beautiful countries in the world are there are endless fun activities. If you’re planning a trip there, be it the Alps or all the great lakes in Zurich and Lucerne, here are the 50 best things to do in Switzerland in summer.

Things To Do in Switzerland in Summer
1. Book a hotel with a view
If you’re going to spend your hard earned cash on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Switzerland, the you might as well stay in one of the most incredible hotels in the world. Hotel Villa Honegg has got a lot of attention recently (mainly due to viral Instagram images!) thanks to its spectacular infinity pool overlooking the Alps.

When it comes to a room with a view, it doesn’t get much better than this! If this is *a little* out of your budget, then below are some equally amazing and unique places to stay in Switzerland with a smaller price tag!



An alternative and much cheaper option is to stay in Chateau Guetsch, Lucerne for just €200 a night or check into a mountain pod.

2. Eat your weight in Swiss cheese
If you didn’t already know Switzerland is famous for its cheese – now you know! One of the most fun things to do on any trip to Switzerland is to see how many different types of delicious Swiss cheese you can eat. Be it for breakfast, lunch or dinner, while sitting in a fancy Fondue Restaurant, or at a picnic in the park you’ve put together for your self, nothing beats a meal of cheese.

We ate at the oldest restaurant in Lausanne and I can happily say I’ve never eaten that much cheese in one sitting in my life – it was heavenly! It should be noted that in Switzerland they don’t really call it “Swiss cheese” as they simply have a huge variety of delicious Alpine cheeses, made from cows milk that comes from the happiest cows in the world.



3. Do a chocolate-making workshop
 Wondering what to do in Switzerland on a cold or wet day? Yes even Switzerland in summer doesn’t have perfect weather! How about a chocolate-making workshop. While Lausanne seems like an obvious choice (milk chocolate was actually invented in the small village of Vevey near Lausanne by Swiss Man Daniel Peter in 1876) we actually did our workshop in beautiful Interlaken.
 
There’s a chocolate-making workshop and cafe there called The Funky Chocolate Club and Ian and I had an insanely fun morning melting, mixing and eating our own chocolatey creations here. it was interesting to learn where the cocoa beans come from, wha the perfect temperature is for making milk and dark chocolate and all the various methods to decorate your chocolate bar! All we ate that day was chocolate – and I know my Dad is still jealous of this fact.
 
Looking for adventure in Interlaken? Why not get the train to Grindelwald and hike to Lake Bachalpsee!

4. Stay in the world’s prettiest hostels
Whether you are on a shoestring budget or not, staying in hostels is weirdly one of the top things to do in Switzerland. They are unlike any other backpackers hostels I’ve encountered around the world – and many are even prettier and better-located than their neighbouring hotels. In Interlaken we stayed at the very famous , which is the oldest private hostel in Switzerland and has more extra facilities than you can shake a stick (of chocolate) at.

There’s a restaurant, a night club, a massive terrace and garden, a room full of hammocks and a play area with foosball and pool tables. We stayed in a private room that was more spacious than some of the hotels we’ve stayed at and the decor was certainly unique!

While we didn’t stay in Lauterbrunnen the hostel we saw there was also one of the prettiest hostels in the world and might be worth checking out for a night or two if you plan to do some hiking. Also, this is the starting point for the train to Jungfraujoch, the highest train station in Europe!

5. Go wine tasting in Lugano
While Switzerland may not be as famous as its neighbouring countries for wine (hello France and Italy!) the wines that we tasted were pretty amazing and Switzerland in summer is drop dead gorgeous. There are even some pretty famous wine-making districts around the country from the UNESCO World Heritage Vineyards in Vevey to the warm, hills around Lugano in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. Ian and I spent a few hours at a very small family run vineyard in Lugano called La Fattoria Moncucchetto.

It was actually really nice to look around a very small vineyard (the produce 35,000 bottles a year and don’t export anything) as well as learning how their various varieties of wine are made. We tasted a few glasses of their 2014 Refolo Brut and both agreed we wouldn’t mind purchasing a bottle on ten! ;-) The bubbles went straight to my head but in a good way! Be sure to visit if passing through Lugano – the views are also incredible from their terrace.

I’ve listed Lugano as one of the top places to in Switzerland. Want to see the the other top 10 beautiful towns and villages? Read this post about “Where to go in Switzerland.”

6. Discover Switzerland’s oldest town
The city of Chur, located in the Swiss canton of Graubünden, is officially the oldest town in Switzerland dating back over 5,000 years and visiting is one of the most unique things to do in Switzerland. The towns official language is German but the main language spoken here is the Alemannia Swiss German dialect. The old part of the town is very picturesque and 100% car free making a visit here even more enjoyable.

7. Cruise down the River Rhine
One of my favourite things to do in Switzerland was a morning spent cruising down the famous River Rhine. We hopped on board in the town of Schaffhaussen in Switzerland and watching in awe as the boat manoeuvred its way down the river with Switzerland to one side and Germany to the other. Was sort of like being in two countries at once.

We passed some stunning little villages, camp sites and absolutely massive mansions on either side of the river and it was by far one of the most relaxing mornings we had.

As most of the boats rides in Switzerland are included in your Swiss Travel Pass, we just hopped off the train and onto the boat with our giant backpacks and took a sort of two-hour detour down the river  then re-joined the train further down the route.

img_0028img_0035img_0041
8. Experience three cultures in one
You may laugh at me, but until I actually travelled around Switzerland I was not aware that there are three separate languages spoken. Four if your can Romansh, a language only spoken in the Graubünden area to the West of the country.

Three languages means three separate cultures and three very different varieties of food. It’s quite fun travelling from the French-speaking area around Lausanne – where you’ll find delicious baked goods, crepes and other delightful delicacies from France to the German-speaking area where you will suddenly see street signs in German and advertisements for Bratwursts!

The moment we got off the train in Lugano it actually felt life we had already crossed over into Italy – expect the prices of course!



9. Descend a mountain in a cable car
Whether you decide to take the cable car up the mountain or down, riding in a cable car is definitely one of the most fun things to do in Switzerland!

In the winter they’re obviously used by the masses to get to the top of the mountains before skiing or snowboarding back down, while in summer there a little quieter and can be used to get to the top of various peaks to admire the spectacular view from the top. As we had a 8-day Swiss Rail Pass, we were allowed to take some cable car rides for free such as the one linking Mount Rigi near Lucerne to Weggis at the lakeshore. 

Switzerland is also home to the world’s first revolving cable car – while we didn’t get to experience this personally I’ve heard it’s an incredible experience. Cable car rides up the mountains is definitely one of the most fun things to do in Switzerland!



10. Take an old cog railway up Mount Rigi
One of the best day trips on our 8-day Grand Train Tour was a morning ascending Mount Rigi in an old cog railway. the incline was seriously steep and the train went at a snail’s pace, but this meant all the passengers could easily hang our the windows and take some of the most stunning panorama shots of the surrounding lakes and mountains.

One photo I took was so spectacular that most of my friends thought it was taken with a drone! Once at the top there is a cafe and restaurant and some great photo opportunities looking back down to the three lakes that surround Mount Rigi.

The walk back down to the cable car station is extremely easy, and you might even come across a paraglider flying off the mount as you walk by! Going up Mount Rigi was one of the best things to do in Switzerland – especially if you’re after some spectacular photos!

rigi-train11. Photograph the world’s happiest cows
Did you know Switzerland is famous for having the “happiest cows in the world”? Apparently, that’s why Swiss chocolate is so famous – it’s all about the rich and creamy milk! We saw these happy cows everywhere we went, roaming freely through fields, hills and with their cute bells hanging around their necks. We never got too close, but we did have fun trying to get some picture-perfect shots of these famous milk-makers!

12. Go skydiving in Interlaken
Forget about Queenstown in New Zealand or Victoria Falls in Southern Africa, I can say with confidence that Interlaken is the new adrenaline-junkie capital of the world.

Whatever sort of crazy activity you can think of, be it skydiving, bungee jumping, paragliding, mountain biking, off-roading, quad biking and loads of others that i can’t begin to explain – they have it. It is also one of the most spectacular spots on earth to go skydiving – surrounded by the dramatic peaks of the Alps. Check out Skydiving Interkalen for info on prices! 

Skydiving in Interlaken has to be one the most fun things to do in Switzerland!

13. Take a steamboat around Lake Leman
One of the things I love about Switzerland is how they manage to combine ancient traditions with modernity. Its home to some of the most complicated banking and technology systems, but still maintains traditional steamboats and old cog railways.

We had the pleasure of taking two separate steamboat rides while in Switzerland but our favourite was a 100-year-old cruise around Lake Leman (otherwise known as Lake Geneva) taking in beautiful lakeside towns and villages such as Montreaux, Vevey and Port Valais. This is one of the best things to do in Switzerland in September – when most tourists have already left!

14. Visit a UNESCO Vineyard at Vevey
The vineyards at Vevay are an unforgettable site that need to be seen to be believed. Whether you rock up as part of a cruise around Lake Leman or stop off there on the train from Lausanne to Montreaux, these stepped vineyards are absolutely stunning.
 
Dating back over 1,000 years, when the Italians brought the first grapes to Switzerland, a half day spent here is a half day well spent! Two famous people also hail from here: Comedy genius Charlie Chaplin and the founder of milk chocolate Daniel Peter!
VEVEY-LAVAUX
15. Explore old railway bridges
Depending on how much time you have in Switzerland, one fun thing to do is to spend a day exploring old railway bridges. We did this while passing through St Gallen, where the tallest railway bridge in Switzerland is located.

There are actually three bridges next to each other – one for cars and two for trains. Whether you walk over them or under them, they are a sight to behold and a great place to meet some locals or even take a dip in one of Switzerland’s many perfectly-clean rivers.

bridges in switzerland



16. Get soaked by a waterfall
This might happen by accident but it will most definitely happen! One thing Switzerland has a lot of is powerful waterfalls. we actually came across a few by accident and the one that we paid to get into was one of the most incredible waterfalls I’ve ever had the opportunity to visit. if you take the train to Lauterbrunnen and take the super-easy 1 hour hike to Trummelbach, you will actually pass about two or three other waterfalls along the way.

If you have a few more hours (or even days) to kill, you can check out all 72 waterfalls to be found in this mountainous region of the country! Trummelbach, the most famous waterfall, has been formed by the melting snow breaking through cracks in the rocks and gushing down into the valley. Because it’s so cold and so clear, the colour of the water is this unusual greyish white colour which can be viewed up close at the bottom of the falls.

To see the falls up close, they have carved steps and platforms into the rock face so visitors can view the waterfall in all its glory from varying dizzying heights.

17. Discover picturesque villages
While Switzerland is famous for a few of its large and well-known cities, the real beauty is to be found in all the small and picturesque villages you pass along the way. It’s best not to try fit too much into your daily itinerary so you have time to hop off the train as you please to have a coffee in a cute little village, take a walk around and unknown lake or simply to take pictures which is what I did.

At one stage I hopped off the train in a town called Spiez with all my bags and left Ian ride on to Zurich by himself as I was so keen to take some drone shots (which you can see below!). The same goes for boat rides – give yourself enough time to jump off at some the more picturesque towns and villages you see along the way.

pretty-flowersimg_1079img_1107
18. Stroll through Stein Am Rhein
A town I had never heard of until a local took us there following a boat ride down the River Rhine, Stein Am Rhein is a medieval town in the German-speaking part of Switzerland with perfectly preserved ancient centre. No amount of photos would be enough in this storybook town – I kept feeling as if I had walked into a fairytale such a Shrek as not one building looked like any i had ever seen before. Dating back hundreds of years, the front of most buildings were perfectly preserved with ancient paintings in beautiful colours. Has to be seen to be believed!

19. See Europe’s most powerful waterfall
If you didn’t get your fill of amazing waterfalls in The Alps, then a visit to Rhine Falls just 40 minutes outside of Zurich by train is  must.

Our train passed right by and I honestly nearly jumped out the window of the train i was in such awe at what I was seeing. I kicked myself for not doing my research and knowing that it existed so I would have known to get off the train!! Don’t make the same mistake as me – plan your journey and be sure to make s all photo stop here!

20. Take in a Zurich sunrise
This wasn’t planned (we just happened to need to get up very early when leaving Zurich) but I highly recommend you set your alarm clock and explore this beautiful city as the sun rises. It’s so quiet and peaceful in the morning, the light is at its best for photographs and the river is flat calm allowing for some stunning reflection shots.

21. Visit the Olympic Museum
While there are lots of fantastic museums in Switzerland, The Olympic Museum in Lausanne is by far the best by a long shot. Located in the Olympic City, the home of the founder of the modern-day olympics and the International Olympic Committee, visiting this museum is both fascinating and exciting.

Perfect for all ages, this interactive museum takes you through the history of the olympics, all about its founder and his life in Lausanne as well as a chance to see signed memorabilia from many of the past Olympic Games. You can take a photo of yourself holding the Olympic Torch from Rio and you can even try your hand at some Olympic Sports from athletics to shooting as well as playing games to test your balance.

Tom Cafe, the restaurant on the top floor, has a beautiful terrace with panoramic views of Lake Geneva and delicious buffet to treat yourself to. My travel buddy Ian has written a separate post all about why he loved The Olympic Museum which you should definitely check out!

22. Tour Switzerland by train
I honestly think the ONLY way to visit Switzerland is by train. There’s this thing called the “Grand Train Tour of Switzerland” which we did. You can either buy a 4 day or an 8 day pass and it essentially lets you travel anywhere in Switzerland by boat, bus or train and even some cable cars. If not covered by the pass, there’s almost always a 25% or 50% discount.

While you might need to make a reservation for some of the more popular trains in the summer, or the panoramic trains through the Alps, we didn’t need to reserve seats anywhere and found travelling from city to city by train super easy for extremely enjoyable.

The ticket also gets your first class so you ride in style! Here’s another great post with more information about travelling Europe by train. Train travel in Switzerland really the only way to go!

23. Cruise around Lake Lucerne
As I’m sure you’ve guessed already – Switzerland is essentially full of mountains, lakes and rivers. around every corner there is a mountain to be climbed and a lake to be explored by boat.

We loved taking an old steamer across Lake Lucerne – the views were spectacular and you can hop on and off as your please visiting some of the pretty lakeside towns that I previously talked about. A great day trip from Lucerne is to check out Mount Titlis – where you can actually plan in the snow even during the summer!

24. Play in the snow at Jungfraujoch
Jungfraujoch – known as the Top of Europe – is the highest railway station in Europe. Located  3,454 metres above sea level, this has snow year round so even if you visit in the summer you can still do a variety of fun winter sports. It can be rather pricey to get to the top – be it by train or cable car – but the people we met who made it up there said it was definitely worth it for the view and the unique “snow in summer” experience.

Just be sure to check the weather before you go as there’s no point going up on a very cloudy day! Learn more about travelling to Jungfraujoch here.

25. Cycle around Zurich
Zurich is a very easy city to get around and despite being known as the banking capital of the world, it is in fact a very beautiful old city with a lot to see and do. Full of excellent museums and attractions, renting a bike and exploring this city on two wheels is definitely the best way to see all of has to offer. Be sure to check out the giant clock face, Europe’s largest clock face at St Peter’s Church.



26. Old railway to Lauterbrunnen
Taking a traditional train from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, or even further up into the mountains if your budget allows it, is one of the most unique things to do in Switzerland. The view is beautiful along the way as the train slowly winds its way up the valley and on arrival in Lauterbrunnen you will feel like you’ve arrived in a fairytale town. Whether you visit in Winter or Summer, a walk around this magical village will put a smile on your face. Grab a hot chocolate at one of the cute cafes or book into one of the most picturesque hostels in the world.





27. Explore lakeside town of Spietz
There are  many amazing lakeside towns in Switzerland to check out! One cute lakeside town only a short train ride from Interlaken, and a perfect stop if you are travelling on to Zurich. Spend a day walking around this town and be sure to check out Spietz Castle, the marina and the church that sits by the lake.

You can also take a boat trip out around the lake if you have time and enjoy the spectacular backdrop of the mountains behind you.





28. Rent a paddle boat in Lausanne
Visiting Lausanne is a little like travelling back in time to the summer resorts of the past. Watch as families sit by the lake enjoying the sunshine or rent a paddle boat and paddle along the shore of beautiful Lake Leman. You can enjoy great views of the Olympic Museum as well as an alternative view of some of the best hotels in the world which live the side of the lake overlooking the clear waters.

29. Watch the paragliders in Interlaken
If paragliding isn’t in your budget it can also be fun to go the park in Interlaken to watch as hundreds and hundreds of them descend on the town, doing flips and tricks, landing mere meters from your comfortable park bench. It’s a real sight to behold and will ensure your photo of Interlaken have a pretty energetic background!

30. Stay in an old jailhouse
There’s a hotel in Lucerne that use to be the city jail. you can now pay to get the full “jail experience” complete with small beds in cell-like rooms, bars on the windows and dim lighting.

A unique Swiss experience for sure! The prison dates back to 1862 – so you might imagine a few visitors while you sleep!

31. Eat a great, big Swiss steak
Like I mentioned earlier, Switzerland is pretty famous for having the happiest cows in the world and some of the world’s tastiest cheese. It’s no surprise that it is also a meat-lovers heaven an is home to the tastiest cuts of steak as well as a huge variety of mouth-watering dried meats.

We treated ourselves to a steak dinner while in Lausanne and it was way up there with one of the best-cooked steaks I’ve ever eaten. Enjoy it with some good Swiss red wine and you’ll be in foodie heaven!

32. Stay in the leading hotels of the world
Switzerland must have more luxury hotels per capita than anywhere else in the world. Some aren’t even widely marketed – they’re just known by those in the know.

Many are famous for having hosted some of the world’s biggest celebrities and one such hotel in Lausanne was the home Coco Chanel for two years and even has a suite in the hotel named after her. Be in castles up in the mountains or 5-star lakeside retreats, many dating back over 100 years, you are sure to find a hotel you’ll never forget while in Switzerland.

We spent two nights in the Carlton Lausanne and I had the most incredible balcony overlooking the street with the lake in the near distance. While the hotel had kept much of its old-world charm (there were even a hotel posters in the breakfast room), it didn’t feel old and the rooms were beautifully decorated.

hotel-carlton

33. Go hiking
There are so many amazing hiking opportunities in Switzerland. You could probably go hiking every day of your holiday and never get bored as the routes are all equally different and equally enchanting.

Climb up to snow-capped peaks or take it easy walking around gently sloping paths surrounding Switzerland’s endless lakes. Take a cable car up and walk back down or if you’re feeling energetic walk up and take an old railway back down.

mountains-2img_1153mountains
34. Take a funicular to Harder Kulm
If you have a few days in Interlaken, be sure to take the old funicular up to Harder Kulm. The large windows and glass roof will allow you spectacular views as you rise up to one the surrounding mountain peaks located 1,322 metres above sea level.

There’s a Chinese restaurant at the top that looks like a mixture between a castle and a temple where you can enjoy the view with a sundowner!  

35. Visit the James Bond restaurant
The famous James Bond restaurant in Switzerland is located at the top of Schilthorn, a 2970 meter high mountain peak in the middle of the country. The restaurant at the top, called Piz Gloria, is where the 1969 James Bond movie On Her Majesty’s Secret Service was set.

The restaurant actually revolves and affords visitors panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. You will need to take a series of trains and cable cars to get here so the reward of such an incredible view is a welcome treat on arrival.

36. Explore Switzerland’s stunning castles
Every village, every town, every lake, every river and everywhere else in between seems to have its own stunning castle in Switzerland. I was blown away by the first one I saw (probably as it’s one of the most famous – Chilean Castle on the shores of Lake Geneva) but that it almost got to a stage when I stopped noticing them as there were so many to take pictures of.

If you take a 2 hour train journey through the Swiss countryside you won’t be able to count the amount of castles you see on both hands. In fact, there is said to be a grand total of 62 castles in Switzerland so see how many you can tick off!castle-switzerland

37.  Listen to Jazz in Montreux
The small town of Montreux on the shore of Lake Geneva is very much a traditional lakeside resort town but with a small twist. It’s most famous for its annual Montreux Jazz Festival held each July, and dating back over 50 years.

It’s the second largest annual jazz festival in the world, second only to Canada’s famous Montreal Jazz Fest, attracting artists and festival-goers from around the world. While primarily focusing on Jazz music, you can listen to all types of music genres imaginable. The festival lasts two full weeks and attracts almost a quarter of a million people each year.

While Switzerland is full of beautiful places to watch the sunset, I particularly loved watching the sunset in beautiful Lucerne. The city has a very unique layout, stretching down each side of the lake, which makes viewing the sunset all the more pleasurable.

You can also take sunset cruises out on to the water and look back on the city as the sun sets behind it. An unforgettable experience. There’s even a bar called ‘Sunset Bar’ as part of the Hotel Seeburg where you are guaranteed the best sunset pics!
39. Drink Swiss wine at Mojito in Lugano
While in Lugano we discovered this very cute lakeside bar called Mojito. Unlike every other bar we frequented on our travels so far, this bar is run by the local community and all profits made of directly back into the running of the bar and funding local festivals and events that take place next to Lake Lugano.

Prices were very reasonable and they served up some of the mojitos this side of the world. Highly recommend visiting and supporting this social enterprise.

40. Take the Glacier Express
No visit to Switzerland would be complete without riding the famous Glacier Express through the mountains, right up to some of the most spectacularly beautiful spots on all of Europe.

Riding this train is like being transported into a Disney movie – complete with huge panoramic, glass windows to ensure you don’t miss a single mountain whizzing by. Taking about seven hours, it goes all the way across the Alps from Zermatt to Davos or St. Moritz. On a single day trip, you will pass by  deep gorges, delightful valleys, 91 tunnels and over 291 impressive bridges!

41. Eat some cobblestone chocolate
If you are spending some time in the Olympic City be sure to take yourself on a self-guided tour up and down the cobblestone streets until you come across the cities most famous chocolate shop.

Here the master chocolatier at Paves Tony makes small cobblestone-shaped chocolatey with a very high alcohol content that are sure to melt in you mouth and have your returning time and time again for more tasty delights.

42. Explore 3 countries in 1 in Basel
Basel is one of the most unusual cities in the world which makes a visit here one of the best things to do in Switzerland. It’s unique location on the border of three countries means that parts of the city are in France, another part is in Switzerland and a third part is in Germany!

Besides its unique location, it was one of the prettiest cities in the country with plenty to keep you occupied for a few days. Basel is also an art lovers paradise – as Jet-Settera found out recently. If visiting during Winter be sure to check out the famous Basel Winter Carnival – the biggest of its kind in Switzerland.

43. Go window shopping in Geneva
Oh Geneva. If you have to ask for the price tag, then you probably can’t afford it! this city is FULL of glamorous shop fronts, women clad in designer clothes from head to toe and people driving cars that cost more than an average house.

It’s quite the experience to soak it all in for a day or two and look on at a lifestyle you will probably never have! ;-)

44. Walk around Kapellbrücke in Lucerne
The Kapellbrücke, or Chapel Bridge, in Lucerne is one of the biggest defining features of the city and a must-visit attraction. Slightly creepy at night, and equally atmospheric, walking around this ancient bridge (the oldest covered bridge in Europe) is an experience you won’t be forgetting.

Be sure to check out the intricate interior paintings that date back to the 17th century and 43 meter tall water tower at the end of the bridge.

45. View the Matterhorn from Zermatt
One of Europe’s highest mountain peaks, at 4,478 metres, this pyramidal peak in the Alps is one of the most recognisable peaks in the world.

If you travel to Zermatt by train, you can go up a perfect viewing platform and view this mighty peak from a sad distance. This is also a haven for experiences climbers who can reach 38 separate four thousand-metre peaks from Zermatt. Here are 10 more interesting facts about the Matterhorn that you may not have been privy to!

matterhorn_from_domhutte_-_2

46. Swim in a Swiss river or lake
I’m not going to lie. The rivers and lakes in Switzerland are not exactly the warmest. In fact, if you are brave enough to take a dip in a river that has been formed from melting snow, be prepared for an icy surprise. While some are warmer than others, they have one thing in common – they contain some of the clearest and cleanest water in Europe and a real delight to swim in. Be brave, make the jump!

river-switzerland

47. Mingle with the rich in St Moritz
It is said that Winter Tourism was actually invented in St Moritz over 150 years ago after a local hotel owner and its gets made a bet with each other.

Over the years, St Moritz has grown into one of the most well-known and prestigious ski resorts in the world – popular with the rich and famous from all four corners of the world. A hub for winter sports enthusiasts – 70% of St Moritz visitors come during the Winter months. Be sure to have a nice bit of savings if you plan of travelling here as winter sports, food, accommodation and everything in between don’t come cheap! Looking for some alternative ski resorts? Read all about where locals would recommend!

48. Eat your way around Gruyères
For the foodies amoung, you (or anyone that simply enjoys some good cheese!) Gruyere should be added to your Swiss bucket list. Famous for the large concentration of cheese factories as well as some of Switzerland’s most famous meat products, Gruyeres is also a picture-perfect medieval town with a lot of history.

Visit the Maison Cailler and Gruyères Chocolate factories, discover how to make traditional cheese at La Maion du Gruyere or learn to make traditional, organic bread in the Adde bread oven. There are literally endless things to do in this tiny place.

49. Have a night out in Le Flon in Lausanne
Looking for the best nightlife in Switzerland? It has to be Le Flon district in Lausanne. While many people would argue it’s all about Geneva – many locals from Geneva actually travel to Lausanne for the nightlife.

This old warehouse district, which is full of retro clubs and new bars which have kept the old warehouse-style architecture and vibe transform this part of the city into an eclectic nightlife area. In the summer lots of live music and festivals take place here and at the weekends the district really comes alive. Be sure to check out the iconic Mad nightclub….you’ll see why when you get there.

50. Visit picturesque Albogasio
While this picturesque village is technically on Italian territory, it can be accessed on a one hour cruise from Lugano, the southern most city in Switzerland. We had to actually google the name when we arrived back to our hostel as we were pretty mesmerised by this tiny but perfectly formed stepped village on the shore of Lake Lugano. A photographers dream – and a village that conjures up images of many of the more famous villages around Southern and Northern Italy.

Editors note: Thank you SO much to Tourism Lausanne for hosting us in Lausanne for two days, to the people at Swiss Travel Pass for kindly sponsoring two 8-day passes and to both the Youth Hostel in Lugano and the Balmer’s Hostel in Interlaken for so kindly hosting us. As always, all opinions are my own and I would highly recommend everyone to visit Switzerland – especially during the summer!

You can have a great time visiting Switzerland on a budget 
Grazing cows in Switzerland
Switzerland is notoriously at the top of every “Most Expensive Country in the World” list, which makes it exceedingly difficult to travel Switzerland on a budget. But that doesn’t have to be the case.

Even the most budget-conscious traveler should have Switzerland on his or her bucket list.

Switzerland is full of dramatic landscapes that can take your breath away.

It’s where you find lush green rolling hills that have quaint little chalets with cows roaming freely around them.

It’s where mountains meet lakes; where you can eat endless amounts of delicious chocolate and of course…cheese.

It almost seems that it’s too beautiful to be a real place.

If these aren't reason enough to want to pack your bags right now than we don’t know what is!

Pro Tip: Need airfare? Find cheap flights and more at Travelocity.com.

Green rolling hills of Switzerland 
Straight out of a fairytale
So how do you visit one of the most expensive countries in the world without breaking the bank?

It’s easier than you might think.

Here are ten helpful tips to keep more money in your pocket while still being able to travel to the wondrous country of Switzerland.

Table of Contents	
How to Travel Switzerland on a Budget
1. Spend More Time in One Place
Switzerland is a tiny country. Consider setting up a home base for yourself and explore the rest of the country from there.

Usually, the longer you spend in one place, the better the nightly rates for accommodations.

This typically holds true whether you’re staying at a hotel, hostel, Airbnb, etc.

Some hotels or hostels will even give you a free local transit pass, so check when booking.

Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo style of architecture.

2. Skip Staying in the Major Cities
There are benefits to staying in major cities. Proximity to everything allows easy access to museums, shopping, and restaurants; but people come to Switzerland for the views.

Switzerland has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, so visit and stay in a town with views.

Not only will it be less expensive, but you're more likely to get the postcard Switzerland that you’re looking for.

You also don’t need to go very far outside the cities to get some pretty spectacular views.

Trains are a very prominent way to travel in Switzerland, so it’s easy to get around even when staying outside of the main cities.

Check out the Swiss Railways website to get an idea of what smaller towns fall on the major train lines.

3. Cheap or Free Accommodations
Nowadays, there are so many options for budget travelers when it comes to finding a place to stay.

You’re no longer limited to choosing between a hotel and a hostel. You can now rent peoples’ apartments or rooms or even stay on someone’s couch.

However, our two recommendations to experience Switzerland on a budget are Workaway and Sleep on Straw.

Workaway

Workaway is an exchange program that, in return for a few hours of work a day, you have your housing covered (and in some cases, a few meals).

You can do a variety of tasks from working with schools, animals, or even farming.

This is an excellent program because it gives you a real, local experience and you are giving back to the community in which you are visiting! Plus your accommodation is free.

Sleep on Straw

Farms in Switzerland started opening up their doors and letting travelers experience a night sleeping on fresh straw.

It has become trendy over the summer months and can start at 6 Swiss Francs ($6) a night. 

What better way to experience Switzerland than waking up on a farm and walking outside to enjoy the mountains.

As with anywhere, you stay, do your research. It doesn’t matter if it’s a hotel, Airbnb, Workaway, or Sleeping on Straw, read traveler reviews.

You might save a buck in the end, but if you end up being miserable because you didn’t read reviews, it won’t be worth it.

4. Buy Food at a Grocery Store
Dining out is expensive; it’s cheaper to buy your meals at grocery stores. 

This is not news to budget travelers. However, there are cheaper grocery stores where you get more for your money.

The two major grocery stores in Switzerland are Migros and Coop. The cheaper budget grocery stores are Aldi, Denner, and Lidl.

Stock up on white wine, cheese, and bread and use it as an opportunity to make fondue!

Another option is to buy “ugly fruits and vegetables” from Coop.

To prevent food waste, Coop began selling “wonky” produce at reduced prices. The produce is naturally deformed but does not have any defects when it comes to taste.

Just because they aren’t pretty, doesn’t mean they don’t taste good.

5. Buy Souvenirs at Grocery Stores
While you’re buying your lunch at a grocery store, why not buy your souvenirs too.

That chocolate may end up being half the price in a grocery store for the same one in a tourist spot.

Many grocery stores in the larger towns often even have a Switzerland souvenir section where you can buy chocolate, cheese, cowbells, ornaments, magnets, etc.

6. Drink Tap Water
Not only is food expensive in Switzerland, but drinks are too (including bottled water).

Luckily, Switzerland has some of the cleanest water available. There are fountains everywhere that you can use to fill up your water bottles.

7. Visit Free Museums
Whatever city you end up visiting, check and see what local museums they have and if they are either free, have free days to visit, or offer other discounts.

There are so many free museums in Switzerland. Below is a list of some of the more popular ones in Geneva and Zurich.

Free Geneva Museums and Sites

Zoological Museum
Augusto Giacometti Entrance Hall
Museum of Modern Art (Free on Wednesdays)
Museum of Anthropology
Botanical Gardens
Fluntern Cemetery (Visit James Joyce’s grave)
Historic Town Gruyères Switzerland

8. Free Outdoor Activities
There are so many enjoyable outdoor activities in Switzerland that don’t cost a dime.

Hiking

Hiking is one of the major activities (the other being skiing) that Switzerland is known for. You could easily spend your whole visit hiking and be perfectly happy.

Swimming

There are quite a few lakes in Switzerland and plenty of places where you can enjoy a swim in them too. They can be a little chilly sometimes!

Explore Historic Towns

Switzerland, like many European countries, is full of ancient and historic towns that you can explore.

Pop into the town’s cathedral for a chance to see some beautiful art. A couple of must-visit towns are Gruyères and Altstadt.

Festivals

One of the best things to do in any country is to take part in a festival. You can see the local culture at its best and usually get fireworks, music, and more.

Free Walking Tours

There are quite a few cities that offer free walking tours. They are run by volunteers and usually provide a couple of tours every day in several languages.

Cheese Making Tours

Depending on the area you choose to visit, there are often small-town cheesemaking farms that will happily show you around and let you see how they make their cheese.

There are also larger factories that give public tours for usually a small price (around 5 Swiss Francs, or $5).

Cheese Making Tours in Switzerland 
That's a lot of cheese
9. Avoid High Seasons
There is no wrong time to visit Switzerland, but the high seasons for visitors are summer and winter.

The best time to visit, and get the most for your money, is during the shoulder months of spring and fall.

Accommodations will be cheaper, and there will be fewer travelers visiting.

If you choose to travel during spring or fall, and hiking is on your list of activities, check and see if trails are open while you are there.

Switzerland Shoulder Season 
Switzerland is beautiful any time of year
10. Invest in a Travel Pass
Travel passes can save you a lot of money, but you must first determine if it's the right pass for you.

If you don’t use passes to their full potential, they can end up being more expensive for you in the long run.

Swiss Travel Pass

The Swiss Travel Pass gives you almost full access to the country; entry to about 500 museums, train, bus, and boat tickets, and more. Again, this can save you money, but it can cost you too.

If you don’t have a plan or itinerary in place of when and what you want to see, it may end up being more expensive for you.

Swiss Half Fare Card

The Swiss Half Fare Card allows visitors to buy train, bus, or boat tickets for half price for up to a month.

If you choose this option, there is very little difference between 1st and 2nd class, and it’s recommended to buy the 2nd class ticket.

Super Saver Tickets

Super Saver Tickets are not a type of pass per se, but when you go to buy a train ticket online, you can sometimes buy a super saver ticket instead.

These tickets are the cheapest available because they are offered at times when fewer people travel.

Swiss Coupon Book

The Swiss Coupon Book offers discounts and a lot of 2-for-1 deals. You can view the deals before purchasing the book.

This is not as popular as the other passes since you probably won’t be able to use all the coupons to make it worthwhile.

However, if you are in the country for a more extended period, it may make sense to buy the coupon book.

Student Passes

If you're a student or are under the age of 18 (and sometimes under 26), you may be able to get student discounts while traveling.

There are so many ways to make a trip to Switzerland come to life without going broke.

No matter if you’re an outdoor adventurer or a history buff, there is plenty in Switzerland that you can do and still have extra money in your pocket after your trip.

Now all you need to do is grab your passport and travel!

Switzerland has some pretty amazing mountains. In fact, the scenery is mind-blowing just about anywhere in the country. Switzerland also has some pretty amazing places to stay where you can take advantage of the views. Your choice of accommodations could boil down to which mountain or lake you want to see.

9. Hotel Chateau Gutsch, Lucerne
Hotel Chateau Gutsch, Lucerne
Fairy tale romances just might come true at Hotel Chateau Gutsch since it resembles a romantic castle overlooking Lucerne. Built in 1898 as a private residence, it is patterned after Neuschwanstein, a romantic Belle-Époque castle in Bavaria. This Lucerne landmark, sitting on a 490-meter (1,600-foot) high hill, offers stunning views of the city, Lucerne Lake and mountains – it’s said to have the most spectacular views of any European hotel. When you want palatial grandeur, you’ll find it here.

8. Whitepod Hotel
Whitepod Hotel
When you’re a guest at the eco-friendly Whitepod Hotel, you won’t stay in bungalows. You’ll stay in one of 15 high-tech pods, a snug geometric-shaped stand-alone building that is self-contained. It’s like staying in an igloo, only warmer since it has its own wood stove. You’ll breathe in crisp mountain air as you make the 20-minute walk from the canvas-covered pod to t he dining facilities. In the winter, you’ll have use of a private ski run as well as runs elsewhere on the mountain.

The hotel is filled with antiques, with some modern décor in the rooms. It offers great views not only of the lake and Mount Blanc but also of Switzerland’s largest water fountain, which stands between the hotel and the lake.

6. Palace Luzern, Lucerne
Palace Luzern, Lucerne
Palace Luzern marked a new level of luxury when it opened in Lucerne in 1906: It had en-suite bathrooms. Built on the banks of Lake Lucerne, it was stately and elegant. It still is today, adding a new distinction in 2015: home to Lucerne’s only fish restaurant. If it’s extravagance you’re after, book the Suite of Arts, inspired by such artists as Chagall and Miro, with furnishings reminiscent of the ‘60s and ‘70s. Rooms have lake or mountain views.

5. Hotel The Cambrian, Adelboden
Hotel The Cambrian, Adelboden
Hotel The Cambrian is located just 15 minutes from Bern, but it seems worlds away from a big city. Originally built in the early 1900s, it remains one of the region’s top hotels. Today it is a 21st century ultra-modern chateau, its stone and slate sleekness interspersed with panoramic windows displaying the mountains and greenery of the Adelboden Valley. You’ll enjoy world-class skiing in the winter, while hiking and biking allow you to explore the environs in the summer.

4. Ascher Guesthouse
Ascher Guesthouse
If heights challenge you, better skip the Ascher Guesthouse (Berggasthaus Aescher), but if they don’t, you’ll love it here. It’s built into the side of a mountain just below the summit of the Appenzell Alps. The dormitory lodge appears to sit precariously on the vertical cliff, but looks can be deceiving; it’s been there for 170 years. Access is via a challenging hike and cable car. The guesthouse-restaurant, with awesome views, is next to Wildkirchli caves.

There’s a reason for this, starting an elevator ride to the rock the lodge sits on, then entering the hotel through a James Bond-style cave and stunning views of the Matterhorn. Its Caverne bar is carved into the mountain.

1. Hotel Villa Honegg
#1 of Amazing Hotels In Switzerland

Most people who visit Switzerland go there to see the very impressive and breathtaking Alps. They're dramatic, they're beautiful, and they're unlike anywhere else on earth. The highest peak in the country is Dufourspitze, which stands 4,634 meters high. If you head to this area in the winter, it has some of the best skiing and winter sports in the world. If you're not a winter sport enthusiast, you can head here in the summer months and enjoy some wonderful hiking or simply hop from charming village to village on the train or bus.

While the Alps are easily the biggest draw to the area, there are definitely some less famous attractions that are still worth visiting. Switzerland has some absolutely beautiful lakes, as well as rolling hills and flat plains. If time allows, definitely make sure you venture out to some of the less visited parts of the country, as they can be quite charming and enjoyable as well.

Whenever you visit, it's important to realize that this can be an expensive destination. Come prepared, and accept that it will cost you more than you'd like. If you know what to expect, you can enjoy it none the less. There are a few handy tips to help keep costs down. In particular, skip activities like the cable cars. They are a fun way to see parts of the country, but they're also one of the most expensive ways. If you're planning to travel by train, book your tickets well in advance as this will save you a good amount of money. Also consider cooking your own meals as restaurants in Switzerland can be shockingly expensive and can really make a dent in your budget. Definitely give yourself a day or two to enjoy the skiing and snowboarding in the area, but realize that if you make this a daily occurrence it will quickly eat through most of your budget. Also consider couchsurfing if at all possible. Accommodation can be expensive and finding a free place to crash will save you a fortune. Many people speak English and are eager to show you their country. It's a fun way to meet and experience a new country and culture.

BEST PLACES TO STAY IN APPENZELL FOR EVERY BUDGET
For all history buffs, there’s nothing better than visiting a destination that takes you back in time. The most traditional village in Switzerland is Appenzell. Picture a fairy-tale-like setting with colorful facades and archaic architecture, you’ll see what Switzerland looked like a very long time ago. The highlight of this tiny village is the picturesque and rustic old mountain inn perched into a cliff called Berggasthaus Ascher and you have probably seen it a ton times on Instagram. With its scenic hiking trail in the Alps and beautiful scenery, Appenzell is definitely calling you! If you do visit this village, below I have picked three accommodations ranging from luxury, value, and budget.

I actually stayed in Appenzell for more than a week because the Alpstein region is just two stops away by train and Appenzell is the biggest town nearby. Alpstein, in my opinion, is the best hiking loop in Switzerland. There’s a few good bakeries and pizza joints in Appenzell to cure your hunger before and after hiking. Other than that, it is a pretty quiet, quaint Swiss town.

Romantik Hotel Santis (Luxury): This 4-star hotel has everything you need to have a comfortable stay. It is run by the Heeb family for ages ago and they really do a great job in taking care of their guests. The hotel has 36 well-appointed rooms highlighting the junior suites. Free buffet breakfast is included of the price with good selections of food. And the bar/lounge is a perfect place to chill and the atmosphere is very cozy. It’s also conveniently set near the railway station so you don’t worry about catching a train to your next destination.

BEST PLACES TO STAY IN ENGELBERG FOR ALL BUDGETS
I stayed twice in Engelberg and it is a bit of a hidden gem. It is a ski-haven in the winter and an unsung hero in the summer with great hikes all around. Engelberg is home to some captivating landscapes and numerous peaks, charming ski spots, and delicious cheese. But the best of Engelberg is in the winter when ski enthusiasts from around the world ski or snowboard over Mt. Titlis and explore Titlis Glacier Cave. What’s more to do in Engelberg? You can cliff walk on Europe’s highest suspension footbridge called Titlis Cliff Walk, watch cheese being made in the factory, climb some peaks, or simply unwind in the spa.

The spa tub and the huge indoor pool are also perfect spots for relaxation after a long day of skiing in the mountains. A free shuttle service is included in the price. It is a very elegant hotel with beautiful panoramic mountain views and clean amenities. The highlight of this hotel is the close proximity to Engelberg-Titlis Ski Resort and Engelberg Abbey.

BEST PLACES TO STAY IN LAUTERBRUNNEN FOR EACH BUDGET
If you want to see the world-famous Staubbach waterfalls in Switzerland, then head to the village of Lauterbrunnen! Seriously, this is one of the most iconic places to stay in Switzerland. You are literally in a valley with huge cliffs on either side and massive waterfalls flow down into the valley. Definitely an inconic spot in Switzerlan. It’s home to 72 waterfalls, and this village is the portal to Jungfrau Region so yes it’s pretty close to the resort town of Interlaken and Murren. This area is situated on a stunning valley surrounded by massive cliffs and features numerous icy waterfalls in the winter. Several accommodation options are ranging from hotels to hostels and apartments. Here are my three best picks in terms of mid-range, value, and budget.

Hotel Staubbach (Mid-range): Imagine yourself waking up with a waterfall view– how enchanting! This family-run hotel offers stunning views of Staubbach Falls and the valley in the heart of Lauterbrunnen.  The hotel rooms are immaculately spotless with comfy beds and private and shared bathrooms. Apart from the spectacular views, another thing that I love about this place is the staff as they are super helpful and when it comes to breakfast, it’s heavenly especially the coffee. Definitely the best hotel in Lauterbrunnen!

Hotel Silberhorn (Value): For me, the Hotel Silberhorn is actually more luxurious than the luxury hotels but it is priced lower for some reason. This is by far my number one pick for where to stay in Lauterbrunnen. As you can see in the photos below, it is super modern, has epic natural light and views from the room and all the amenities are new. It is set next to the train station, this family-run hotel offers cozy rooms and a sun terrace where you can chill and unwind after a long day of exploring numerous waterfalls.  There is a cable car that runs past the hotel and it’s just a stone throw away from the train station. If you are lucky enough, you can get a room with an excellent waterfall view. And wait until you meet their staff. They are very welcoming and helpful to every guest. Location wise, I’d say this hotel is highly recommended!

Valley Hostel (Budget): Let your adventures begin at this budget accommodation in Lauterbrunnen! Not only this hostel gives you budget-saving rooms but also it’s very handy when it comes to location– very near to the train station. With superb reviews on booking.com, I can understand why it’s the most popular budget accommodation in Lauterbrunnen. Just look at that pool!  From the balcony, you can enjoy the best view of the waterfall and valley while having your morning coffee. The hostel also has a garden, a ski storage room, and laundry facilities. If you want to save your money for your adventures, cook your meal in their communal kitchen. This is by far the best hostel in Lauterbrunnen!

BEST PLACES TO STAY IN CHUR FOR EVERY TYPE OF BUDGET
Chur is the oldest town in Switzerland. This small region is just a lovely little day-trip from the hustle and bustle of Zurich; just 1.5 hours away by train. It is a jumping point of the Glacier Express and rides onwards to Zermatt as well as the legendary and scenic Bernina Express to Tirano. Apart from that, there are tons of things to do and see in this traditional town including the visit to the infamous Alien Bar, underground Church, museums, and more. The hiking nearby Chur is also great. If you visit this town, these are my three accommodation options when it comes to luxury, mid-range, and budget. 

ABC Swiss Quality Hotel (Luxury): This 4-star hotel offers 48 clean and modern rooms equipped with relatively good Wi-Fi connection, a minibar, and a Nespresso coffee machine. For $184, you can get a private single room with complimentary extensive breakfast. The hotel only provides breakfast on site though. But don’t worry as there are plenty of good restaurants nearby the hotel for lunch and dinner. Indulge in their sauna and take advantage of the 24-hour fitness center and free private parking. This hotel is popular due to its central location which is close to the railway station, shopping district, and the old town for sightseeing.

Central Hotel Post (Value): If you are looking for a spotless hotel that is good value for money, then you might want to check out Central Hotel Post. This hotel is set in the heart of Chur which means it’s very close to the railway station, museums, cafes, and restaurants. The highlight of the Central Hotel Post is the buffet breakfast.

VIVA Hostel (Budget): This hostel is ideal for budget-conscious travelers and party lovers as they have budget rooms and a dance club on site. The hostel rooms are clean and functional with private and shared bathrooms plus free Wi-Fi throughout the property. It’s pretty basic but I think this place is perfect if you don’t want to spend more on accommodation and if you only stay for a couple of nights. The staff are very friendly and they will certainly help you with your needs. There are nearby restaurants and shops for you to have your meal after a long day of exploring the town. Budget-wise, I’d certainly recommend this hostel.

MY PERSONALIZED SWITZERLAND TRAVEL TIPS
SWITZERLAND BUDGET BACKPACKING GUIDE: In this blog, I talk about the cost of travel and how to travel around Switzerland on the cheap with some tips and hacks from my experience.

20 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO: MY SWITZERLAND TRAVEL TIPS: You probably didn’t even think of half of these. I didn’t either and figured many of these tips out the hard way.


MOST IMPORTANT TRANSPORT TIP: SWISS HALF CARD
OPTION 1: Switzerland trains, buses, and cable cars are EXPENSIVE! I found the best way to get around cheaply was to buy the Swiss Half-Fare Card before I arrived. It gives you 50% off every regular train, bus, and even many cable cars. It only costs $150 USD but pays itself off in just a few days with many train tickets in Switzerland costing close to $100 alone. OPTION 2: The second option is to get the Swiss Travel Pass, which gives you unlimited train, bus, and (many) cable car rides but it’s pretty expensive at around $100 USD per day so if you don’t travel each day it isn’t worth it. OPTION 3: The final option is to get the FLEXI Swiss Travel Pass, which allows you to buy 8 days’ worth of transit but you can choose the night before if you want to activate the next day. That way you don’t need to travel every day to get your money’s worth, you can just activate the FLEXI Swiss Travel Pass on the days where you are doing sizeable transits. My advice is to book the Swiss Half-Fare Card or the FLEXI Swiss Travel Pass in advance before your trip so it’s ready to go when you arrive.

Switzerland has been one of the most popular tourist destinations for many reasons. The snow-capped peaks, the stunning vistas, endless snow sports, or just relaxing by a roaring fire with a cup of world famous Swiss hot chocolate or cheese fondue in hand. Whatever your reason for visiting Switzerland, you just have to make sure that you’re visiting during the right time.

Determining the best time to visit Switzerland will help you plan your entire holiday, and also let you finalize on what activities you’ll be able to do. So, read on to find out when to visit Switzerland, for your ideal holiday!

QUICK FACTS
Best time to visit: April – June, September – October
High Season: July – August
Low Season: October – March
Best Ski Season: December – March
All Seasons: April – June (spring), July – August (summer), September – October (fall), November – March (winter)
The best time to visit Switzerland is during the shoulder seasons, between April and June, and September to October, when the weather is at best, and there aren’t too many tourists.
The high season is July to August, when the weather in Switzerland is the warmest it is in the entire year, but you will have to face a lot of tourists, and over 50% increase in prices.
Winter (between December and March) is low season in most parts of the country, as there will be intense snowstorms. However, this is the best season for those who want to go on ski trips.
Switzerland is a country that at once defies all stereotypes, and lives up to all of them. It’s truly the land of picture–perfect mountains, postcard like villages, amazing cheese, chocolate, and utter peace. However, there is more to discover of this country than most people would expect – from the strict punctuality of the Swiss, to their utter hospitality. You will definitely find something amazing at every corner, there is no doubt that this is one of the most picturesque destinations you’re ever going to visit in your life.

Depending on what you want to do, you will be able to discover different parts of Switzerland, no matter which part of the year your travel in. However, there are certain seasons when the weather in Switzerland makes the destination impossible to resist. You just have to identify the best time to go to Switzerland, based on what you like to do best!

SEASONAL OVERVIEW
April to June – Spring / Good Season
Lugano, a city in southern Switzerland
The city of Lugano, situated on the shore of Lake Lugano
April – June is a good season to visit Switzerland for a number of reasons. The snowfall would have just reduced to bearable levels, so you will still be able to see Switzerland for the winter wonderland that it is. Moreover, the crowds from the ski slopes would have also left, and the summer crowd would not have trickled in yet, and you will be able to find most accommodation and travel tickets for cheaper.
The weather in Switzerland might be slightly wet during this season, but the accommodation will be cheaper, the wildflowers will be blooming all across the valleys, and a ride on the cable cars will offer stunning views.

Avg. Temperature: 60 – 74° F / 16 – 23° C (in Zurich)
Rainfall: 137 – 173 mm
Season: Spring
Highlights: There are some places you must definitely visit during these months, especially hiking. All trails up to 2000 m will be clear of snow, providing you a clear path to trek up, with stunning snow–capped peaks to view. This is also a great time to catch those quaint scenic train rides, as well. Make sure you visit Lake Lugano, on the Italian–Swiss border (make sure you carry your passport). Lake Maggorie, and Ronco Sopra Ascona are also stunning places to visit. Make sure you stop by Ascona, for its famous art festival, Artisti di Strada in May, or by Geneva for Fete de la Musique in June.
July to August – Summer / High Season
The Matterhorn is a mountain of the Alps

This is when most tourists descend on Switzerland, and if you visit the country during this period, you will know exactly why. The weather is perfect and warm, with wildflowers growing all across the valley. The snow thaws during this season, even in the higher passes, so you will be able to hike those trails as well! 
Summer is one of the busiest seasons in Switzerland, only second to the ski season on the slopes. The prices can go up to 50% higher in the resorts in the mountains, and travel will also be quite expensive. However, all the mountain resorts will be open now, so you will get a great choice of places to stay in.

Avg. Temperature:  80° F / 27° C (in Zurich)
Rainfall: 73 – 151 mm
Season: Summer
Highlights: This is a good time to go to Switzerland if you want to enjoy wonderful treks. Towards the middle of the season, even the higher trails will open up for hikes. You will also get your own share of adventure sports to choose from – including biking, paragliding, and more. Lake Geneva is a must–see destination. Summer also has a number of festivals – from Fete de Geneve (July–August), or Bol d’Or Mirabaud, the continent’s biggest yacht race, held in Geneva. You can also head to Montreux, with its world-renowned jazz festival.
September to October – Fall / Good Season
Paragliding in Interlaken
Tourists paragliding flight over Interlaken
These months are absolutely stunning. Fall is always a great time to visit – the weather is pretty warm, but mildly chilly. The days start getting shorter about this time, and the vibrant fall colours begin taking over the slopes. There won’t be as much snow on the higher peaks, and the crowds from summer would have started to leave around this time, making fall a cheaper time to visit. Moreover, you will get better seats on transport, and on the cable cars, now that you don’t have to fight for your spot!

Avg. Temperature: 57 – 75° F / 14 – 24° C (in Zurich)
Rainfall: 38 – 53 mm
Season: Fall
Highlights: You’ll find the best wine during this season, as this is when the grape harvests happen. The higher passes and pass roads will start closing by October, so visit those spots before they are closed. This is the best time to visit Interlaken, where you can see the stunning Jungfrau. A number of people head to Lake Brienz and Lake Thun for paragliding, or even swimming. Thun has a number of other adventures on offer during this season as well – including flying a 1930s biplane!
November– March – Winter / Low Season

Zermatt, the jewel in Switzerland's crown and one of the world's best ski resorts
This season is rather contradictory. It’s both the high season and the low season. Many resorts close around this time, but the ski slopes will be wide open, with a number of tourists. Especially around Christmas, a lot of tourists head to Switzerland to experience the snow–capped mountains, and the wonderful ski opportunities (not to mention the Christmas markets). The prices will go down in other parts of the country, except for the slopes – which is where most of the crowds will also be concentrated.

Avg. Temperature: 41 – 50° F / 5 – 10° C (in Zurich)
Rainfall: 25 – 196 mm
Season: Winter
Highlights: Head to the Valais Region, which is stunning during this season. Head to the Zermatt or Saas–Fee, where 500 odd kilometers of skiing and snowboarding awaits you. Whether you want a view of Monte Rosa, or Matterhorn, you will definitely have a great time. Take a trip on the Gornergrat Railway, or the Klein Matterhorn Cable Car, to discover views that are straight out of a magazine.

WITZERLAND ON A BUDGET: 7 TIPS TO PLAN YOUR TRIP
 Add Interlaken to Your Switzerland Itinerary
Last Updated: 07/22/19 | July 22nd, 2019

Switzerland conjures up many images. On one side, there are majestic mountains, delicious fondue and chocolate, big banks sheltering people’s money, precision watches, and an orderly society. On the other, heart attack–inducing prices: $8 USD coffee or beer?! $50 steaks?! A $15 menu at McDonald’s?! $35-40 hostel beds?! WTH!

Switzerland is rated the most expensive country in the world to visit, with Geneva and Zurich being two of the ten most expensive cities to live in.

And because visiting Switzerland so expensive, it’s easy to see why so many people skip over the country and wait until they are older and (hopefully) wealthier. When I mentioned I was visiting Switzerland on a budget, many people shook their heads and wished me good luck with a “poor soul to think he can do that” expression.

I’ll admit I was worried. While I’ve found that not all “expensive” destinations need to be tough on the wallet (though some are unavoidably expensive), Switzerland travel seemed daunting, having a strong currency and high taxes, and being a mecca for rich banks, international organizations, wealthy residents, and tax shelterers.

Switzerland will never be a “dirt cheap” country to visit, where travelers can visit on just a few dollars a day, but I found to my surprise that it’s possible to travel the country on a relatively light budget.

How do you save money in Switzerland?

Well, it’s tricky but not impossible. Here’s how you can do that:

How much I spent in Switzerland
Here’s how much my trip to Switzerland (Zurich, Bern, Geneva, and Interlaken) cost (in Swiss francs (CHF), which are worth $1.03 USD):

Food: 105.75
Accommodation: 171.36
Transportation: 222.30
Metro: 17.40
Alcohol: 66.90
Attractions: 30
Total: 613.71 (or 76.71 CHF per day)

Overall, I did a good job of keeping my costs around $79 USD per day. Granted, it was a lot of work. I relied heavily on the sharing economy (see below) and cooking my own food. Being able to hike and visit free attractions also helped, though in wintertime when you have to pay to ski, this might not be the case. Having spent a few days in Zurich in the past, I didn’t feel the need to eat out a lot (and I don’t drink coffee) so I was happy to eat my own food versus ordering expensive restaurant food. Alcohol cost a fair bit (11% of my budget) but there was no way I was going to Interlaken without partying in the famous Balmers (also the only hostel I stayed in the entire time).

My biggest mistake was not paying attention to the fact I was flying in and out of Zurich. Since I went from Zurich to Geneva to Zurich, that meant I doubled back, costing me an extra 100 CHF in train tickets! This was such as stupid mistake, and I still kick myself for it. I mean, how could I miss such a simple thing?! If I had gone one way, I would have saved a substantial amount of money and significantly lowered my average spending. Always pay attention to your direction to save money on transportation. It’s a hard and fast rule of mine and I completely messed up.

Suggested Daily Budget in Switzerland
How much should you spend in Switzerland? Well, that depends. How do you travel? Depending on your budget and where you want to spend your money you could spend as little as $50 a day on a tight backpacking budget where you couchsurf, cook all your food, and limit your alcohol to the skies the limit where you’re spending hundreds a day just on accommodation. Below is a chart of some suggested budgets based on different travel styles!

How to Save Money in Switzerland: My 7 Tips
 Take in the Beautiful Scenery During Your Trip to Switzerland
I kept a lot of my costs down because I don’t participate in many adventure activities and visited the country when I could hike (a free activity). While I could have trimmed some expenses (gone in one direction, drank nothing, avoided that Starbucks in Geneva), I don’t believe that you should not do certain things simply for the sake of being cheap (Live a little, right?). Even if I had done ridesharing or Couchsurfing during my visit, I would have put extra savings into other activities. (Be frugal, not cheap is my travel philosophy. So I think my budget was just right for the country.)

Here are seven high-impact ways to save big money in Switzerland:

Switzerland Travel Tip #1: Use Couchsurfing — With dorm rooms starting at $30-40 per night, you need to lower your accommodation costs. Couchsurfing is the way to do it. It’s a service that lets travelers stay with locals for free (more on it here). It was a lifesaver that allowed me to keep my costs down the most. Since a lot of travelers use this service, make your requests for hosts early. I put in 25 hosting requests in Geneva before I found someone to stay with!

Switzerland Travel Tip #2: Use BlaBlaCar — Transportation is very expensive, even more so than accommodation. Most intercity trains are around 50 CHF. That adds up too quickly! Instead, use the ride-sharing website BlaBlaCar to avoid the trains and meet locals. This website lets you rideshare with people, and though I only used it once, it saved me $50 and I met a cool French father and son team on their way to Germany (I got to practice my poor French):

 Sharing BlaBlaCar in Switzerland, enroute to Germany.

A word of caution: be advised that many rides cancel. I had three rides cancel on me at the last minute (and one guy who just failed to even show up), so the service requires some flexibility. But when it works, it’s awesome. And it’s definitely something I want to use a lot more in Europe.

Switzerland Travel Tip #3: Use hotel points — Hotel reward points are a lifesaver in expensive destinations, where even hostels are expensive and the chance of getting a Couchsurfing host is small. Rack up a few hotel points by travel hacking before your trip and burn them while you stay in the country. Most hotel sign-up bonuses are around 60,000 points, which is worth about five nights at the chain hotels like Hilton, Marriott, or Starwood (just make sure you stay at their cheaper properties. Sorry, no W for you!).

Alternatively, Airbnb is also a good deal if you’re traveling with someone, as most private rooms are around $50 per night. Split two ways, that’s only $25 a person, much cheaper than a hostel dorm!

Switzerland Travel Tip #4: Don’t drink — Drinking is not cheap here. Most beers are around 8 CHF. (Plus, who wants to hike while hungover?) Most wines are between 10-25 CHF a bottle. If you must drink, stick to hostel bars where you can enjoy 2-for-1 happy hours and cheap drinks for around 5 CHF.

Switzerland Travel Tip #5: Cook — With sit-down restaurants costing around 40 CHF per meal per person, eating out in Switzerland can be very costly, so buy your groceries. A week’s worth of food (bread, pasta, rice, eggs, vegetables, cheese, deli meats for sandwiches, and some assorted fruit) will cost you 75-100 CHF. The major supermarkets are Migros, COOP, and Spar. COOP is the most expensive.

Switzerland Travel Tip #6: Go veggie — Meat is expensive in Switzerland. Every Swiss resident or expat I talked to told me about how they limit their meat consumption because it costs so much. Stick to veggies and avoid buying meat for your meals (especially beef). While I was trolling supermarkets and butchers for grocery prices (travel writing is glamorous, huh?!), I found a pound of meat was 12-14 CHF. At that price, stick to deli meats for protein!

Switzerland Travel Tip #7: Use lunch specials — If you are going to eat out, do so during lunch, when most lunch specials cost around 10-19 CHF. Moreover, stick to the ethnic restaurants like Chinese, Middle Eastern, Indian, or Thai for the best deals and biggest portions (and closer to that 10 CHF price). Lunch specials are a great way to get a lot of bang for your buck and to enjoy the dinner menu but at a cheaper set menu price — this is the only way I eat when visiting countries as expensive as Switzerland. Cook breakfast, eat out lunch, cook dinner — you can’t go wrong!

Switzerland is an expensive country to visit — there’s no doubt about it. I think the floor for what a backpacker/budget traveler should travel Switzerland on is around $75 USD. At that price point, you’d have enough money to do the basics, stay in some hostels, go out, and enjoy some adventure and outdoor activities. Anything cheaper would limit your ability to really enjoy what Switzerland has to offer.

But no matter your travel style or what you plan to do, following the tips above will allow you to visit Switzerland on a budget by cutting wasteful spending and focusing your hard-earned travel money on what you want — whether that’s museums, beer, adventure activities, or a pound of meat.

Well done. That’s an exceptional budget for Switzerland.

The one thing I’d add is that drinking in saves as much as eating in. We found very good bottles of Spanish Rioja in the supermarket for around 7 CHF . . . bottles that easily would have cost $30 in the States. So if you like wine and are cooking in anyway, there’s no reason not to indulge. At about $1.50 per glass for very nice wines we found vino to be one of the rare bargains in Switzerland..

The same for beer: if you buy beer at the supermarket, it can be inexpensive. The cheapest option is “prix garantie” beer from coop supermarket for less than 1 SFr for half a litre .
“Coop prix garantie” products from coop supermarjets, and the “m-budget” fro m migros supermarkets are very good quality for less money. They just look cheap- the quality is the same like the nicer looking expensive products. So 100 g m-budgez chocolte tastes great- and sets you back obly 0.65 SFr.

cooking is definitely a life savior when traveling on a budget!
I had never really thought of going to Switzerland, and yup, because I thought one couldn’t possibly do it on a tight budget. So thanks for this post, Matt!

As you say, it’s expensive. best would be to rely on some old or new friends that you maybe met along your travels for slepping or maybe even to end you a car 🙂

Great tips Matt. I travel to Scandinavia regularly and I practice some of these there. I was glad (not for you, but for me) to see you’d had difficulties with BlaBla rides cancelling. I tried to use a Danish version this year (for the life of me can’t remember their name) and ended up having to get a flight because none of the rides came through.

You did a terrific job keeping your budget to just $79 per day. I’d have thought it impossible.

Great advice for Switzerland, Matt. We spent a week in Switzerland in early December a couple of years ago, and just avoiding restaurant food saved us a ton of money. We rented an apartment, cooked there, and made Basel our headquarters. Since we had a Eurail pass that we used to travel in Germany and Austria as well as Switzerland, the average cost of transportation was much less. We flew into and out of Frankfurt, using our train pass to get us to and from the Frankfurt airport. The Christmas markets and beautiful scenery were all the entertainment we needed, and we were delighted that our rail pass covered some of the most scenic railway journeys in Switzerland.

For european citizen, I think the best is to travel there in your own car and do wild camping. Maybe the best thing would be to rent a car in France then travel to Switzerland and sleep wherever you can. And bring your own food and cook coz the food is expensive. Even swiss people come to France to buy food.

You can not camp wild in Switzerland! I was there in 1996, ok that is a long time ago, but I could not camp wild, I got taken to the police station just to asking if i could sleep in the train station as it was pouring rain and i only had a bicycle, no car. I seriously doubt they would let you camp wild. But the camp sites (at least back then) were not much more expensive than anywhere else (with just bike and tent, that is).

REPLY
AnneLyMay 25, 2017 at 3:45 pm
Yes you CAN camp wild in Switzerland! There just some rules.
First: free camping above 1800-2000 metres( ehere there are no more trees) is widly accepted. If on private property ask for permission ( and buy some local product like some goat cheese). But remember- no noise, and dont leave anything but your footsteps, and dont taje anything but pictures.
Below 1800 – 2000 metres it is forbidden in the national park and in wildlive protection zones. Dont try to do wild camping next to a big street or parking lot. Put up your tent after day visitors have left and put it down before the next day visitors arrive.
Definitely allowed is “biwaking” that means soending the night in the natute because there was no more time to get to the next hut/village before night falls. So if caught -tell them you could not make it any more to the next hut without getting in danger because of the night/ the bad rainfall/…
I often spwnd the night in the nature. Never near a parking area or street, and it is teally a great eay to experoence the best of Switzetland- for free.

Don’t beat yourself up about flying in and out of Zurich. There are so many more flights to Zurich than Geneva, that it probably would have cost more than $100 more to fly in/out of Geneva (and you would have fewer options).

Wow, well done.
I must admit, when I was in switzerland the eurail pass saved me (one of the few countries that it works well because you don’t pay fees on top of your pass, and because train fares are normally very expensive).
I agree with you, the best thing to do in Switzerland is to hike because thats free. I did do the Jungfrau bahn but apart from that i steered clear of the adventure stuff (do that in NZ for half the price!).
I must say I am surprised you stay in Interlaken, I prefer to get up into the mountains and stay in the villages such as Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, found Interlaken to be too big and touristy, the smaller mountain villages are nicer, and you get to be closer to the hiking trails!
Yep food is expensive, I stocked up in Italy before crossing the border as it was cheaper but if you miss out on the chocolate then you haven’t really been to Switzerland.
My best advice is get out of the cities, they aren’t really Switzerlands main attraction, the mountains are and in the mountains just go hiking, that will save you money.
I did Switzerland on a $100 AUD budget so not quite as good as you did.

Yes, head out of the big cities. Go to some smaller less famous mountain villages than famous St. Moritz, posh Gstaad or Zermatt. Villages like for f.e. Kandersteg- great scenery, great walking tracks, some great overnight hut trecks.
Another inexpensive way to spend the night in the countryside is on farmstays, called “schlaf-im-stroh”. You just need a sleeping bag.

I recently spent 6 weeks in Geneva but I was house sitting for a friend so that made it much cheaper (and he had a coffee machine!). You definitely need to check prices before you buy anything. I’d been in Prague and Budapest and hadn’t really paid much attention to prices then went to buy a box of cookies with my coffee pods. I grabbed them without thinking then checked the receipt. That tiny little box of cookies cost me over $16!

The Geneva card is good value for travel around town and sightseeing. I didn’t use it this time but did last year when I was there. There are reasonable places to go out to eat. It’s probably best to ask locals (true everywhere, I guess).

Another tip, for travelling across borders, check the train prices for both countries. I had to travel to Milan and the train prices were much cheaper on the Italian site for the same trip.

REPLY
NomadicMattOctober 10, 2015 at 9:54 am

Another tip for cheaper eats is to ask where the locals eat, which can be very different in Europe in general than in the U.S. Some of the cheapest Swiss restaurants I found were in the basement of a large train station and in the upper floors of old-school department stores, which often have inexpensive cafeterias to keep their patrons longer. Also, large grocery chains sometimes also have really good, inexpensive cafeterias.

I believe you could have saved some more if you had arrived via Geneva. Friends there insist that I arrive there as it appears even the train tickets out of Zurich are at a higher rate than tickets out of Geneva. Don’t beat yourself over doubling back to Zrh as the cost of the “open jaw” arrival in Zrh and departure through Gva is usually more than 100 usd.

I did Wild Camping at the trail heads on the way into the mtns and foothills. There are open faced warming huts. Got a free ride on the local bus/ also paid to get there. Even in torrential summer rains was comfy enough compared to the $25 a night basic/ crowded hostel. With a small tarp/ light sleeping bag and pad could also camp anywhere in the hills – with decent weather.A pack cover to hide your pack in the bush- then spend days touring the area. In the morning hiked down to small villages on the fringe of the tourist areas – market bought croissant/ yogurt/ fruit then ordered a coffee with a view or right on a gorgeous lake (they are all like this in Switz!) Can be one great big adventure – if you are patient you can cut your travel costs as Matt pointed out- being creative in this regard will work also.

Great post Matt. Switzerland took a lot of work for me too not to blow my budget. I got a ridiculously low airfare deal when SAS had a promotion. I admit if you go during Fasnacht, you can eat soup and hot dogs to save money. The parades are free (they do ask that you buy a pin to support the parades), plus they throw things like fruit, flowers, chocolates and I even have a pair of large inexpensive shoes.

I agree that flying into/out of Zurich may have been wise because your airfare was probably lower than Zurich/Geneva.

Living in Switzerland myself, there’s a few things I disagree. Major supermarkets are Migros and Coop, as well as discounters like Denner, Aldi and Lidl. Spar isn’t common at all and more expensive than Coop.

A beer only costs $8 if you’re drinking it at the touristy in-places. If you find a bar or restaurant in a district off downtown, it will cost less.

As for coffee, indeed stay away from Starbucks (at least don’t go for their special creations that cost more than normal coffee). Tchibo, McCafé and the restaurants of Migros and Coop are slightly cheaper, or just visit a local coffee shop in the neighbourhood.

I also hope tourists don’t get a wrong impression from your article photos. We do have dirty, stressful cities here too 🙂

I love Switzerland but got just two days of my life to visit while driving in from Germany and going ahead to Milano/Pisa in Italy. Unlike most travellers, I preferred staying in a country side motel rather than Zurich. So we went as far 57 kilometres inside the countryside from Winterthur to a cool place to live in Lichtensteig.

And I must say I enjoyed the cool and fresh breeze of Lichtensteig and enjoying sipping coffee in the balcony of the motel early each morning. We spent our day at Zurich (and were lucky to be there to watch celebrities rolling in for the Zurich Film Festival 2014).

Someday, I will go again to Switzerland – but this time for a longer stay and the tips here would definitely help me to plan a budget trip. Thanks

Hey there, I was just reading this post about Switzerland out of curiosity, as Im Swiss and Im always wondering what tourists think of our lovely country.
I know its really really expensive, even for us guys just living here. (being a student over here, oh boy trust me, I am struggling sometimes..)

A few tips that might help: If you’re planning on using public transport (which is quite good btw) get a tourist half fare card. I cant remember how much you pay for it, but afterwards you’ll only pay half the price for all your tickets. Most Swiss guys have one, and it really helps. You can also use it if you’d like to visit Zermatt or Interlakens Top of Europe and sometimes there are even special offers including a day pass for famous ski areas all around Switzerland etc.

Also for groceries: Migros is cheaper than Coop for most products. Volg and Spar are more pricey. The cheapest supermarkets are probably Aldi and Lidl (German discounter) Alcohol is way cheaper if you buy it in supermarkets. Except Migros doesn’t sell alcohol. You’ll get nice local Swiss wine for under 10 francs.

Thats about it, as far as i can think of.
Once again, lovely blog, and a very warm welcome if you ever happen to come back.

Thank you very much for this. I last visited Switzerland in the late 1990s and am planning to go there with my daughter this summer. I recall on my 2 weeks stay in 1996 that, after bracing myself for the ‘expensive’ country, it was not all that expensive if you stay with friends and eat and drink at home. I still had a great experience. My daughter doesn’t like eating much, so we don’t need restaurants, and I don’t have to drink alcohol while traveling alone with a child. Unless I am visiting friends in which case we can drink at home. I’ve booked an air bnb with kitchen for the part of the trip where we will not be with friends.

Our main spending will be on cable cars up the mountains, which we plan to do. And a special treat of thermal baths.

The area I’m concentrating on is mainly just over the northern italian border – Matterhorn, Eiger, Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen being the main spots I wish to visit. Hiking will make up the majority of the activities. Hopefully the mountains aren’t covered in cloud. Load up on trail mix and Trekker bars – a week of non fine dining is doable to keep costs in check.

I might go and travel Switserland on a budget, last time i did not and i can not say that i enjoyed spending a lot of money. The hotel i stayed at was quite worth it though.

Matt for your information you
wrote that Switzerland has high
taxes. I live in this country and can assure that taxes are not high but reasonable. Salaries and hourly rates are high compared to other countries.
Education is also cheap compared to the exorbitant prices like in UK and USA etc.
We do not attach snobbery to which school or university you went to. I do not see how one can comment fully after travelling in a country say for 8 days or even for a year for that matter. One needs to live there and integrate as much as possible and speak the local language/s reasonably well.

Dear hazel,
Thanks for putting things in perspective about switzerland.

Dear matt, thanks for information, i too have this notion that visiting switzerland would cost a bomb, specially if i am taking my entire family. I would definitely keep your tips in mind.

Hi Matt, great tips from you and I do wish I will be able to keep to a comfortable budget for myself too when I visit in May. I realised that you did not mention about getting any passes (i.e. Swiss Travel Pass or Swiss Half Fare Pass). May I know why you did not consider getting that?

Because shops close earlier in Switzerland I found going to the supermarket 30 to 60 minutes before they close good as everything is marked down 50 – 60%.

Also if you are going for the train journeys like I do you can use the Swiss rail pass to get free public transport in the cities and free ferry rides. Did ferry rides in Luasanne and Zurich.

The pass also gets you discount or free entry to some tourist attractions and museums. 50% of gondolas etc in Zermatt. Mt Pilatus in Luzern is also free

Great tips Matt! I didn’t even consider a few of them to be honest. I’ve never ever tried hotel points. How does one even set up that system to collect them? (Hope I don’t sound silly asking). I usually just use booking.com and pay no attention to any other details about my hotel stays. Do the ones on booking.com count or is it only special hotels?

Also, the comments have a few useful nuggets of information as well. Thanks guys!

Thanks for your Tips.. however , As a Swiss, I do not agree with many of them. you can spend $40 up on a meal in Switzerland . But you don’t have to.. you can eat out for much less esp. for lunch . I never payed $8 for a coffee in Switzerland – not even in Zurich ( I lived there for 10 years)
If you travel to Switzerland, why would one go to Starbucks or McDonalds??? While you can get good Swiss food or a coffee in a nicer coffee shop …

Hello Matt, is it legal and safe to sleep in your car in the summer? That would be a great saver.

if you not going on winter , rent a car ,sleep in the tent wild and wash in the rivers or pay for showers on campsites . Eat markets food on stove like on camp . That the way I was doing in 2001-2003 , each trip with my own car cost me *shared with my friend – max euro 250 for 10 days and we have seen all most scenic places in this country – from south east to south west and central . It was before internet era and digital cameras . Prices now are not higher than max 10% more , since I was last time .

The 10 Most Beautiful Places in Switzerland

Switzerland has always ranked highly among the best places to be born and live happily. You only need to walk outside your door to see why -- it’s beautiful. From mountains to valleys, charming lakes to historic cities, Switzerland is so breathtakingly gorgeous that it almost looks like a set from a Hollywood film: That is, until you walk among the fields, the stone paths, and over (and sometimes through) the mountains, and discover that it’s beautifully real. So, for those travelers looking for a bit of beauty in their travels, we’ve compiled a list of the most beautiful places in Switzerland that you really can’t miss. 


1. Lake Lucerne
Lake Lucern at the Hotel des Balances/Oyster

Lake Lucern at the Hotel des Balances/Oyster

Lake Lucerne is the fourth largest lake in Switzerland, and by far, one of the most beautiful. It was in a meadow above the lake that the Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291, sealing the lake’s fate as an important place in Switzerland’s history. Today, the city of Lucerne sits on the stunning blue shores of this oddly-shaped body of water that’s encircled by mountains. There are multiple ways visitors can enjoy the beauty of Lake Lucerne. Take a 30-minute boat ride to the funicular of the Burgenstock Resort which takes guests up the Burgenstock mountain to unrivaled views of the lake. Then hike for 20 minutes to the Hammetschwand Lift, the tallest outdoor elevator in Europe (also located on the property), for an even more expansive view. Taking the aerial cable car up Mt. Pilatus is another fantastic way to get great views of Lake Lucerne from above.

Switzerland is made up of one beautiful mountain after another, and it’s at the Jungfraujoch where travelers can see some of the big beauties up close and personal. The Jungfraujoch is home to the highest train station in Europe, which has been open since 1912, sending travelers to the station that sits between the Jungfrau and Monch mountains. At the Jungraujoch, visitors can walk outside onto viewing terraces to witness the snow-covered mountains, as well as the Aletsch glacier, the largest glacier in the Alps. If the beautiful white glaciers and mountains aren’t wonderful enough on their own. there’s also an Ice Palace within the station that guests can walk through to experience beautiful ice sculptures.

3. Bern
The Penthouse Suite at the Hotel Allegro Bern/Oyster

The Penthouse Suite at the Hotel Allegro Bern/Oyster

Bern, the capital of Switzerland, was founded in 1191. As it grew along the Aare River, the town flourished over the centuries into one of the most visually appealing cities in Switzerland. Unlike others in Europe, Bern maintained its historic Bell Époque–style among the buildings of the Old City. The cream-toned structures are remarkable in their detail, lining  stone streets dotted with stunning water fountains. Rising above the city is the Bern Minster, a 328-foot-high Gothic-style Protestant church that looks over rows and rows of buildings with spires and red-tiled roofs, all the way to the green countryside and mountains that surround the city. Climb 220 steps up the Bern Minster for stunning city views, or take a bus to the elevated Rosengarten Restaurant and enjoy a delicious meal and delightful city views of Bern.

4. Castle of Chillon

Dating to 1150, the Castle of Chillon is a beautiful castle that sits on an island on Lake Geneva. With 350,000 visitors per year, it is currently the most visited historic building in Switzerland. Once you see it, it’s no surprise why. Stone walls, round towers, and a romantic setting? Yes, please. The castle belonged to the Counts of Savoy from the 12th to the 16th century, and today, visitors can see 14th-century paintings, underground vaults, and 25 buildings and three courtyards. Fun fact: The castle was made famous by Lord Byron’s poem “The Prisoner of Chillon.” Byron scratched his name into a pillar at the castle, and it can still be seen today.

The Interlaken area of Switzerland is by far one of the most breathtaking areas in the country. The region comprises Lake Thun, Lake Brienz, and the cities that dot the lakes or sit between them, like the city of Interlaken. The two lakes combined with three mountains that stand above — Jungfrau, Eiger, and Monch — create an awe-inspiring scene. Today, travelers come to this region for many reasons, from exploring the small lake towns to visiting Thun Castle or St. Beatus caves to heading up the mountain to Jungfraujoch. Skiing, hiking, tobogganing, and witnessing the Lauberhorn Ski Races are also other popular things to do here. If you want great views of Interlaken, take the Harderbahn up to Harder Kulm, a viewing platform with phenomenal views of both lakes, the mountains, small towns that dot the countryside, and the city of Interlaken that sits between it all.

Martin Abegglen/Flickr

You can’t leave the Matterhorn off a list of the most beautiful places in Switzerland. The Matterhorn is a stand-alone 15,000-foot mountain in the Swiss Alps that looks like a jagged tooth. Most travelers stay in Zermatt to witness stunning views of the giant, though an excursion to Gorgnergrat also offers great views from a viewing platform. Unfortunately, there’s no railway or cable car to take travelers up the Matterhorn, so the only way to see it up close and personal is by mountain climbing.

The city of Lauterbrunnen sits in a green valley between the snowcapped mountains of the Swiss Alps, however, it’s not the city, per se, that makes this spot beautiful. Rather, it’s the 72 waterfalls that flow along the cliff edges of the valley during the summer when the snow melts. The very name “Laterbrunnen” means “many fountains,” and the sight is a spectacular thing to witness. The most famous of these waterfalls is the Staubbach Falls, which run pretty strongly throughout the year. At nearly 1,000 feet high, the Staubbach Falls are one of the tallest free-falling waterfalls in Europe.

The Swiss landscape is a magical mix of different types of land formations, and perhaps, none more so than Creux du Van. Over the centuries, the land has shaped itself into what looks like an amphitheater cut from rock. The Creux du Van transformed into a semi-circular three-quarter-mile long structure by erosion from water and ice. To witness this natural wonder, travelers must hike more than 2,000 feet up. The path then takes visitors along the edge of the arena. Trust us, this isn’t a show you want to miss.

Near the town of Meringen is the Aare Gorge. It’s the product of water from the Aare River eroding a bed of limestone. Today, the water is more than 600 feet deep, with some of the narrowest sections only a yard wide. There’s a three-quarter-mile path that can be hiked along the Aare Gorge, which takes adventurers along bridges and through tunnels. The limestone walls of the cliffs rise high above hikers making for a unique path among the many mountain hikes of the country.

The Rhine Falls is the largest waterfall in Europe, and, not surprisingly, one of the most beautiful spots in Switzerland. The Rhine Falls measures 490 feet feet wide and 75 feet high, and it’s approximately 15,000 years old. It’s located in the north of Switzerland near Schaffhausen. Visitors can take a boat to the falls, and they can enjoy the powerful natural wonder up close and personal by standing on platforms that jut over them. Just be ready to get a little wet, but who cares? The photos will be worth it!

Wife and I are planning to go to Switzerland for 2 or 3 days as part of a larger two week vacation. We fly into Zurich and want to travel down into Italy and make it to Rome. Our return flight back to the US leaves out of Zurich as well, so we will be coming back up after we make it to Rome.

There is a lot we'd like to see in Switzerland. We would like to see Zurich, Luzern, Interlaken, and possibly Basel, Bern, Lausanne & Geneva. Id love to see the castle in Montreux (or any castle in CH for that matter). We might do some hiking for a few hours on one of the days, but its not mandatory for us. Would also like to drive a car through some scenic mountain roads.

The most important thing is keeping our budget in control on this trip. We plan the majority of the trip in Italy with Milan, Venice, Cinque Terre, Siena, Pisa, Florence, San Gimignano, and Rome on our wishlist. I think Tuscany we want a car to drive around as well.

I need help :) Im considering two options... renting a car for the whole two weeks and driving around Switzerland and then down into Italy. Probably take a train straight back to Zurich. Second idea is to take train most of the time and rent a car once in a while... say for some scenic Swiss alps or in Tuscany area.

More important, Switzerland looks very awe inspiring and would really think I need to drive a car there. Eurorail prices arent exactly cheap, and I was guessing renting a car (even with fuel prices) would still be cheaper than two rail passes for two weeks.

To save money, we were also planning on finding campsites along the way or inexpensive hotels (not hostels). Maybe even sleeping on a train overnight... although everything is so close together and most trips from city to city are short.

Would anyone have any trip ideas? Is driving the whole thing a pipe dream? :) We like to dine out, but realize to save money we'll skip much of the dining out experience. We love farmers markets so will probably just snack on stuff at those places each day.

Thanks for anything! Dave :)

Your Switzerland list is enough to fill two entire weeks. Why not limit yourselves to Switzerland this time and see all those places you want, and leave Italy for another trip? This is far, far too much for two weeks.

If you're looking to save money I'd say skip Switzerland completely. It is a beautiful and very interesting place but when people say it is expensive, they are NOT kidding.

Also, you have way too many places for a 2 week itinerary. You could spend a week alone in Rome. I'd say stick to Italy and maybe skip Milan. Out of the way of the other places you've mentioned and, in my opinion, unimpressive.

You will need at least 3 full days for Rome, 2 full days each for Florence, Siena/San Gimignano/Pisa, driving around Tuscany, Venice, and 1 day each for 5Terre and Milan. Count another 4 days for train or highway travel between these places.
Count about 6 days for the places you want to visit in Switzerland.
Don't underestimate the time you need for making your luggage, leaving the hotel and going to the train station or out of town up to the highway: add at least 1 hour to your point to point travel time at each end of your journeys.
And don't foget that a day at which you arrive at your hotel at 3pm is almlost lost, as you will hardly be able to begin your visit of the town before 4pm, that means at a time at which many museums and other sights will close.

So, if your trip will last more than 3 weeks, I will be pleased to give you any advice about Switzerland. If not, it's not even worth to speak about.

"renting a car for the whole two weeks and driving around Switzerland and then down into Italy. Probably take a train straight back to Zurich." - please spend 5 minutes to get an offer from Avis/Hertz and see how much extra it costs to leave a car in another coutry - and have a truk taking it back - simply get a quatation leaving the car in italy and one taking it back.

"Eurorail prices arent exactly cheap, " - why Eurail passes and not just railway tickets? These passes are not somethjing given away for nothing - they are for ppl. that by some reason like passes for railways (but buy normal tickets for their flights) and are willing to pay. Remember that there are NO "Eurail trains".

And agree with above - make 2 weeks for Switzerland (your second paragraf gibe a fine "first time visitor - see main sights" plan for those 2 weeks) - or simply take those palces that you can - logistically - pass in those 2-3 days. (no jetlag??).
It is a ridicoulously short time for a wonderful - very costly - country, but so are 2 weeks for Italy.

Forget about European fuel pricves -first european cars goes MUCH longer/liter than US-ones and secondly for a short trip in Switzerland + northern/middle Italy the fuel expenses will be microscopic - like the price for a 2-3-4 good dinners.

Thanks so much for all the help everyone! I have some big decisions to make. We are going into Switzerland because we needed a visa (Italian consulate didnt have any dates available b4 our trip). Anyways, we will be going through Zurich. We're going to Italy because my wife used to live there. She knows Rome, but not northern Italy so we want to explore it.

We are very light travelers so luggage shouldnt be a problem. I am viewing this trip as more of an overview of both Switzerland and Italy and our next stays we will spend more time in places we end up liking.

I know its a lot to see. And we may just have to cut some things out... Like not going to Geneva, not going to Venice, etc. We understand that.

Cities within Switzerland also look close to each other. I am in Southern California so driving two hours is not a big deal. Personally, Id love to travel all by rail, but we want some adventure too, and not just see tourist stuff.

If you absolutely want to rent a car (Italian trains are often faster: Rome - Milan (609 km) in 3 hrs; scenic Swiss Alpine trains are much more than only transport), you would better do all by car.
Consider a loop like Zurich - Lugano - Menaggio - ferry - Varenna - Bergamo - Verona - Venice - Ravenna - Perugia - Rome - Florence - Pisa - Genoa - Aosta - Lausanne - Zurich.

Agree with first poster that 2 weeks won't cover. I would also suggest doing one country at a time. Switzerland is extremely expensive. Regarding Italy, I preferred the Tuscany Region: Florence, Pisa, Verona, Venice. Rome was a huge disappointment for me, but I loved Florence.
If you want to see Alps I would suggest Austria, which is MUCH cheaper than Switzerland. I recently spent 6 days touring the lake region of Austria outside of Salzburg via auto. It was just lovely.
I have the luxury of living in Germany, and I have found that the most memorial vacations (and cheapest) are that in the former Communist bloc countries: ie Romania, Hungary, Czech, Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. More "bang for your book" and not at all as touristy (although Prague was touristy)...Sorry for veering off the original post, but just some food for thought.

Western Austria is not MUCH cheaper than Switzerland and is not along the route from Zurich to Rome. Cheaper rural Eastern Austria is out of question.

If Saskvoch drives from Zurich via Austria to Venice, he will probably sleep in the Bolzano area: the cheapest 2bed room at Bolzano offered by booking.com costs 116 EUR (31.8). The same at Locarno or San Nazzaro (Lago Maggiore, Switzerland, 90 km from Milano) costs 110 EUR.

When is the best time to visit Switzerland?
November 2, 2019 Last Updated on December 10, 2020
by CAROLYN
Are you ready to plan your holiday but are wondering when is the best time to visit Switzerland? Of course there is no actual best time to go to Switzerland – what’s best for you may not work for the next person.  However, in my opinion, any time is a good time to visit Switzerland!

In this guide, I’ve covered a number of factors to consider when deciding which month you will visit Switzerland so that you can determine the best time to visit Switzerland for you.

The ‘best time’ may depend on when flights are cheapest, when you can get time off work, or when particular events that you want to participate in are happening. Other considerations include if you want to hike or ski, for instance.

Lake Brienz, Switzerland
Deciding when is the best time to visit Switzerland depends on a number of factors including which activities you’d like to enjoy.
A couple of the Swiss panoramic trains (Glacier Express and Gotthard Panorama Express, for example) and some of the mountain cableways and funiculars cease running over the winter months, so if you’re desperate to enjoy one of these rides, this should be a consideration, too.

Check Switzerland’s cable car and funicular closure dates for the upcoming winter in this article.

Before we dive in and discuss the different times of year to visit Switzerland, let me just clarify that the seasons in Switzerland – as in the rest of Europe – are determined by the Summer and Winter Solstices.  Therefore, Summer actually starts on 21 June, the Summer Solstice – or longest day of the year – and finishes on 20 September.

For the purposes of this guide, I’ve used full months to discuss the pros and cons of visiting in each season, rather than the specific dates as you’ll see below.

Best time to travel to Switzerland
Below I have listed some pros and cons to visiting in the different Switzerland seasons, along with what you can and can’t experience during those months, so you can make an informed decision on the best time to travel to Switzerland – for you. 

Spring in Switzerland
Official dates: 21 March to 20 June
Months: March, April, May

Montreux in Spring
Montreux is awash with colourful blooms in Spring.
Spring is an exciting time to visit Switzerland.

Because it’s the country’s true off-season, you can likely score good deals on flights and accommodation (which, considering the price of everything in Switzerland, could make or break your trip). You also won’t end up fighting the crowds, which introverts might find particularly refreshing. 

That said, Switzerland weather in March can still feel quite wintery, with highs around 6 degrees Celsius and lots of rainfall. It could easily dip into freezing territory at night. 

Because of the cooler temperatures, but longer daylight hours (daylight savings starts on the last Sunday in March), this is actually a great month to get your skiing in. The Alps are still snow-covered but there are fewer tourists. 

Still, if you visit right after Easter (which can fall at the end of March some years), you’ll find many cable cars are shut down until hiking season begins at the end of May. So if you have your heart set on the trails or scenic mountain top views, keep that in mind. 

Gruyeres Castle
If you love cheese, a visit to Gruyeres on the first Sunday in May is a must.
Switzerland in April, on the other hand, starts to warm up. It’s too warm to ski in most of the country, but like I mentioned above, some of the summer tourist attractions and hiking trails will be boarded up for another month. 

Flower lovers are in for a real treat in April as the Morges Tulip Festival takes place on Lake Geneva throughout the month.

If you’re travelling on a budget you will find the best deals during April, so check attraction websites carefully and see what’s open when you’ll be there. And dress in layers! 

For slightly warmer and more predictable weather, the average Switzerland temperature in May hovers between 15 and 19 degrees Celsius. Warm enough to melt the snow and for you to get a glimpse of the under-appreciated narcissus blooms. 

And if you love cheese as much as I do, you can visit Gruyeres on the first Sunday of May for their annual Cheese Festival. 

Summer in Switzerland
Official dates: 21 June to 20 September
Months: June, July, August

Switzerland in Summer
Summer in Switzerland means an endless selection of mountain excursions to enjoy.
The months of June through August are one of the two ‘peak seasons’ in Switzerland. The weather is balmy, the hiking trails are open, and the lakes are ready for boaters and swimmers. 

As such, the prices for accommodation are high and all the popular locations will be packed with fellow tourists. 

Summer is high season for coach tours as well as independent travelers so attractions like Jungfraujoch and Mt. Titlis will be heaving with visitors.

If you’d like to travel during the Swiss summer but would prefer to avoid huge crowds at the major sites, you’d be wise to visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon, or choose sites and attractions that are a bit more under the radar – think Mt. Niesen or Mt. Stockhorn, for example.

GET SWITZERLAND TRAVEL TIPS, NEWS, SPECIAL OFFERS AND INSPIRATION DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EVERY MONTH.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP!

Weekends also tend to be particularly busy during summer as the Swiss head to the mountains to go hiking.

June is when the peak hiking season begins, and all those cable cars that shut down after Easter are re-opened. The trails shouldn’t be too muddy, and since the Switzerland temperature in June is generally warm, it should be a pleasant time to get views of the valleys. 

One of the major events that takes place in Switzerland during summer is the Montreux Jazz Festival which runs from late June to mid-July.


If you visit Lavertezzo’s famous double-arched bridge during the summer months, you might be tempted to take a dip in the river.
Switzerland weather in July on average gets up to 24 or 25 degrees during the daytime, making it perfect for swimming. There are plenty of places to take a dip, but try Lake Sils or the Aare River if you need a recommendation. 

It’s not uncommon for temperatures in the lower lying areas to reach 30 degrees or more so it’s definitely worth considering booking a hotel or apartment with air-conditioning if you are visiting Switzerland in summer.  Even a day or two with temperatures above 30 degrees can make things very uncomfortable.

At the end of the summer, Switzerland weather in August is still warm, hanging out around 25 degrees Celsius in the heat of the day. You can still enjoy a dip in Lake Lucerne, but one of the best reasons to visit Switzerland during August is Swiss National Day on 1 August, where you’ll find festivities all over the country complete with bonfires and fireworks. 

Other fun summer activities include biking around Lake Lucerne, or going down the snow-less bobsled near Basel called SolarBob. 

Whichever way you look at it, you can’t go wrong visiting Switzerland in the summer, although you should be prepared to share your journey with thousands of other eager tourists. 

Autumn/Fall in Switzerland
Official dates: 21 September to 20 December
Months: September, October, November

Switzerland in Autumn.
Beautiful autumn foliage adds to an already stunning landscape.
Perhaps the best month to visit Switzerland to get the best deals, fewer fellow tourists and most comfortable weather, is September.

It’s the start of the shoulder season meaning prices get more reasonable and you won’t have to share attractions with as many people, but the weather is still reasonably warm, meaning you can still enjoy most summer activities (except swimming, perhaps). 

And while the days are getting shorter, they’re still long enough to feel like you can make the most of the precious time you get to spend in Switzerland! 

During September, the Alpine villages across Switzerland welcome the cows home as they descend from the mountains back to the valleys in what is known as Almabfahrt or Almabtrieb. Villagers celebrate as the cows, wearing flower crowns, are welcomed home with fanfare and yodelling.  This is one festival everyone should experience once in their lifetime.

The annual descent of cattle from the high pastures is a fun event to witness during Autumn/Fall in Switzerland.
The annual descent of cattle from the high pastures is a fun event to witness during Autumn/Fall in Switzerland.
In October you’ll get the benefit of seeing the leaves begin to change. While higher trails may get snow-covered (and you get fewer daylight hours), you’ll enjoy colourful fall foliage views which are hard to beat. 

Just keep in mind that cable cars and funiculars may begin to shut down in the later part of the month due to snow or for their annual maintenance (check closure dates here).

Switzerland weather in October becomes chilly, but not overly wet. You’ll need a jacket and won’t want to take a swim, but it’s not time to pull out the waterproof gear just yet. 

For those who enjoy wine, October is the best time of year to go to Switzerland. The Basel Wine Fair falls at the end of the month each year, but the whole month is grape-harvesting season. 

Daylight savings in Switzerland ends on the last Sunday in October.

November, unfortunately, is one of the worst months to visit Switzerland weather- and activity-wise. It gets chilly and wet making all the summer activities unpleasant, but there’s not much skiing to do yet and it doesn’t quite feel like winter. 

That said, if you’re someone who travels for museums or other indoor historical sites, November might be the cheapest time to fly to Switzerland, and you will get great deals on accommodation.  And with entry to more than 500 museums included in the Swiss Travel Pass, you will definitely get great value if you’re using the pass to travel around.

Winter in Switzerland
Official dates: 21 December to 20 March
Months: December, January, February

Zurich in winter
Zurich dusted with snow.
December through February are the official winter months in Switzerland when the snow starts falling and it’s prime time for skiing. Prices in the mountains begin to skyrocket, and the lodges fill up fast, but if you want to visit Switzerland for winter sports, there’s no other time to go. Personally, I think the best place to spend a winter holiday in Switzerland is the Jungfrau Region. 

Switzerland weather in December is officially cold, cloudy and wet, so plan to spend your time either on the slopes or indoors by a fire enjoying hearty food and warm drinks. 

Believe it or not, you can’t expect a white Christmas all over Switzerland. If you really want snow, make sure you’re high up in the Alps when booking your accommodation – and book well ahead. That said, the Christmas markets in Switzerland are amazing and well worth a December visit, snow or not. 

See this year’s Switzerland Christmas market dates here

Why not ring in the New Year in Switzerland? Like anywhere there are loads of celebrations to enjoy with the added benefit of going skiing. But the cool thing about Switzerland is they don’t just celebrate the new year once – on 13 January the Swiss bring out the party once again and celebrate the beginning of the year according to the Gregorian calendar. 

Christmas markets aren’t the only events taking place in Switzerland during the winter months. There are numerous major events held around the country including the Snow Polo World Cup at St. Moritz, the Lauberhorn Ski World Cup in Wengen and the International Hot Air Balloon Festival in Château-d’Oex.


Zermatt is a real-life Christmas card scene during winter.
The Switzerland snow season formally begins in January, where the weather hovers around 0 all month, rarely getting above 2 degrees. That lasts through February, where it may get up to 2 degrees during the day, and you’ll get a little more sunshine, but still reliable skiing weather. 

If you’re not fussed about skiing and would like to enjoy warmer temperatures consider visiting the canton of Ticino or the Swiss Riviera (alongside Lake Geneva) as both enjoy milder climates than other parts of the country.

Another thing to consider before you decide to travel to Switzerland in winter is how you will get around.  If you are planning on joining an organised coach tour, there are less itineraries and departure dates to choose from during the winter months.

Rail services continue to operate as normal, though, and for those who prefer to drive, roads are regularly cleared of snow.

Visiting during Switzerland’s winter months also means less daylight hours to see the sights as well as the necessity of bringing sufficient warm and waterproof clothing which can be bulky, so keep these things in mind, too.

Final Thoughts
So there you have it, a quick look at the pros and cons of travelling during all of Switzerland’s seasons. Armed with all this information, I hope you’ve determined the best time to visit Switzerland for you.

When is the Best Time to Visit Switzerland?
Spring | Summer | Autumn | Winter | What to wear

Just give me the short answer
The best time to visit Switzerland really depends on what you want to do, see and experience.

Although we have four distinct seasons, weather varies extremely and depends on the altitude. We have very low and very high elevations, mountain ranges, deep valleys and plateaus where winds can be strong; therefore we experience a multitude of micro-climates.

We often experience unusual weather patterns: snowfall during late spring and early fall, a cold snap in June, even in summer; heat waves or frosty nights in July and August, thick fog below 1000 m to 1200 m (3.281/3.937 ft) above sea level between early October and early spring.

And when the mild but strong Föhn (a warm wind or Chinook for North Americans) blows through the valleys the climate changes in an instant; snow melts like chocolate in the sun and people complain about headaches.

We have places with snow year-round - to name just a few: the Jungfraujoch in the Bernese Oberland, Mt. Titlis near Lucerne, Diavolezza in the Engadin, Zermatt and Saas Fee in the Canton Valais and Glacier 3000 in the Vaudois Alps (Les Diablerets). The Aletsch glacier can be viewed from the Jungfraufoch as well as from Eggishorn above Fiesch, Bettmeralp and Riederalp in the Canton Valais.

The sunniest and driest regions are the Canton Valais and the Engadin in the Canton Graubünden with more sunny hours per year than the rest of Switzerland.

The rainiest areas are around Lucerne, St. Gallen and not for nothing are the meadows of the Canton Appenzell lush and Irish-like green. Then again, even if the Canton Tessin is known as "our Sonnenstube" (sun-lounge), the heftiest storms are to be experienced around Lago Maggiore. The foggiest area is on the central plateau - especially around Lucerne in winter, the Mittelland, and along the Rhine and Lake Constance. The Bernese Oberland and the Swiss Riviera are somewhere in-between.

And then, the forecast is often not reliable as well. Apparently it's hard to foretell anything in the Alps. You can check it in the morning for the next day and when you check again at night, the forecast may has changed.

So you see, the weather is as varied as our small country.


Spring - 21 March to 20 June
Spring is when nature awakens - deciduous trees get their greenery, meadows display a wide range of flowers, cherry and apple trees start to bloom, fields fill up with narcissi, flowering magnolia trees in the south display their exuberant beauty and bear garlic finds its way through the ground cover of dead leaves - a welcome addition to many dishes. And fog disappears.

When is the best time to visit Switzerland? A guide throughout the seasons - Spring

Spring starts earliest in the southern part of Switzerland. Forsythias, camellia and magnolia trees are already in full bloom in March, especially around Lago Maggiore and Lake Lugano in the Canton Ticino.

In the rest of Switzerland, March is still on the cool side and usually snow fall is frequent, even in the lowlands. Although the lower the altitude the faster the snow will melt again.

Alpine regions and ski resorts are still mostly covered with snow - March is an excellent time for skiing: the sun is warmer, the slopes are still in perfect condition and the crowd has disappeared.

The ski season ends on Easter weekend. About two weeks before Easter, school holidays start all over Europe and more people frequent the pistes and prices tend to go up again.

The ski resorts pretty much shut down after Easter and hotels reopen again in late spring for the summer season; funiculars and cable cars/aerial cableways close and stop running until end of May/beginning of June when the hiking season starts.

The weather gets a tad warmer around mid April to early May and the narcissi fields bloom and a wide range of flowers appear on meadows. The wind is quite strong in western Switzerland, especially around Lake Geneva as well as in the Mittelland.

May weather is a fickle thing. It could be summer with temperatures in the mid-20s but it could easily be the opposite with cold days and frosty nights, even in the lowlands. It can rain, hail, or be hot - you never know. And as higher up you go, the cooler it gets. May is still too early for high alpine hiking since snow patches still cover the ground. Funiculars and gondolas may not be open until end of May, early June.

The hiking season starts officially in June and the high tourist season at the end of the month. The weather is usually better than in May, quite balmy and with less precipitation. High Alpine meadows fill up with flowers.

Summer - 21 June to 20 September
This is the peak tourist season with July and August being the most crowded months, especially on the well-trodden tourist paths around Lake Lucerne, the Bernese Oberland and Jungfrau Region, the Swiss Riviera and parts of the Canton Valais with Zermatt topping the list.

When is the best time to visit Switzerland? This pictures shows Lake Thun in summer

You will have to make hotel and apartment arrangements early if you want to find convenient accommodation and avoid paying an arm and a leg. Of course, you always can find a hotel room in smaller villages a little outside of the tourist centers. However, keep in mind that this will add up travel time for sightseeing. If you drive a car that wouldn't be a problem but if you use public transport - even though excellent - it adds time to your schedule and it might not be convenient if you have lots of luggage.

Summer brings plenty of sunshine but ironically it's also the rainiest season, especially along the north side of the Alps.

Then again, summer weather is as unpredictable as it is during the rest of the year…

Even though 2015 started out cool and wet - way below average - the weather in June, July and August was almost as hot as in 2003 - the hottest year since one started measuring temperatures 150 years ago. Jackets vanished for months; people lingered in street cafes late into the night and impromptu beach bars popped up around lakes and on river banks. Whereas July and August in 2014 brought on the rainiest summer season experienced for decades. 2018 was so dry that wells started to dry up.

Autumn - 21 September to 20 December
September and the first three weeks in October are great months for outdoor activities. Rain is less frequent and though you might experience the first snowfall in the Alps, usually the white stuff is gone within a couple of days. The hiking trails are less busy, the nights are crisp but the days are sunny and balmy. It's my favorite time to spend outdoors in the mountains.

When is the best time to visit Switzerland? Fall is a particularly colourful
View through the bus window: an atmospheric fall day in the Goms Valley (Canton Valais)
Indian summer is a great time to experience the change of colours - from green to golden to shades of reds. Autumn colours start to appear sooner at higher altitudes than at lower levels. You will see trees and bushes turning colours over 1000 m (3281 ft) at the beginning of October. Then again, this also will depend on the temperatures. Usually, larches are at their best in the mountains from late October to beginning of November.

The grape harvest early to mid-October brings festivals abound. One place you always can taste wine and learn about the cultivation of grapes is the Vinorama in the Lavaux vineyards on Lake Geneva.

But it's also the time when mist and fog start to creep in around lakes and on the central plateau, especially around Lucerne as well as around Lake Constance and the Mittelland, the Swiss Plateau.

When is the best time to visit Switzerland? Fog in the lowlands in fall, clear view above. View from Beatnenber to the Bernese Alps

Funiculars and cable ways start to close their operation around October 20/25 - some just for a few days for maintenance but most close until the ski season starts around mid-November. The same applies to hotels in ski resorts or pronounced tourist areas. Some sightseeing options close during winter, for example the Open Air Museum Ballenberg near Brienz.

Of course, the Jungfraujoch (Jungfrau Region) and Mount Titlis (Engelberg) are accessible 365 days a year; the Schilthornbahn (Mürren), and the Firstbahn (Grindelwald) close only for a few days of maintenance as does the Gornergratbahn and the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise (Zermatt). Mount Pilatus (Lucerne) will be accessible by gondola only (Golden roundtrip only possible between May and October). Some of them close entirely for winter, for example Rothornbahn, Harder-Kulm funicular and Schynige Platte. These are just a very few examples so please check operating hours for mountain transportation before you visit.

November until mid-December is usually a bit drab since rainfall can be quite intense, daylight gets considerably shorter and the weather grows colder. "Frau Holle" may not have started making her bed by sprinkling the slopes with snowflakes. Trees are leafless and larches lose their beautiful and intense yellow-orange fall needles, flowers are gone from the windowsills, the gardens and the meadows.

Of course, you always can go shopping in our beautiful towns and cities, visit museums and Christmas markets, enjoy plays or get pampered in a wellness resort.

Winter - 21 December to 20 March
Starting at an altitude of 1200m - 1500m (3937 - 4921 ft), precipitation during winter usually occurs as snowfall, and these areas are usually covered by a solid layer of snow until end of March - mid April. Most Alpine passes are closed for transport.

When is the best time to visit Switzerland? Winter in full swing on Riederalp, Canton Valais
Magical wintertime on Riederalp (Aletsch Arena), Canton Valais
It's chilly no matter where you will be staying.

While the high Alpine area is covered in snow, lower altitudes may not experience snow until mid-January. In the most southern parts of Switzerland (Ticino), on the central plateau (around Lucerne), the Mittelland (Solothurn) and the greater Geneva and Basel areas you might only experience snow on a few occasions during winter.

Usually there's low fog on the plain topping out at about 1000m (3280 ft) above sea level. Sometimes breaking up by lunchtime and sometimes not. It's damp in the lowlands and the cold feels colder than the same temperature in the Alpine areas, where the weather usually is sunnier and drier.

It seems though that winter starts later and later - White Christmas did not always happen lately - especially below 1000m (3280 ft.) If you would like to experience Christmas in the snow, then visit ski resorts on very high elevations to be sure to get your fill of that beautiful fluffy whiteness.

The winter climate is unpredictable as well. Ski areas are subject to changing weather and road conditions. Resorts can't always open the ski season as planned. If you are into winter sports and are looking for guaranteed snow, mid-January to mid-March is the best time to visit Switzerland.

You don't have to be a skier to enjoy the splendid alpine vistas. Sledding, skating, snowshoeing, winter hiking on groomed trails, wellness in one of the thermal baths and many more winter activities will keep non-skiers entertained as well.

From Christmas to the beginning of January is a very busy time in the ski resorts (less so in cities) and hotel prices peak. Like during the summer months, make reservations early because returning visitors scoop up hotel rooms and apartments as far as a year in advance. Also, most hotels in ski resorts want bookings of 7 nights over Christmas until at least the first week in January and during February (Saturday to Saturday).

Wonder what you should wear?
As you see, weather in Switzerland is somewhat temperamental and ranges from Arctic to Mediterranean. We do have a saying: "There's no such thing as bad weather, just the wrong choice of clothes."

While it's approximately 27 Celsius (80.6 F) in Lugano in July, it will be about minus 4 Celsius (24.8) on the Jungfraujoch. Here's a list I compiled with historical average temperatures in Switzerland.


Basically, pack clothes so you can dress in layers;
Even if you visit in the warmest season do pack a sweater for those chilly evenings and crispy mornings in the Alps and a jacket for visiting mountain tops;
A folding umbrella or lightweight waterproof anorak for the casual sightseer;
Good walking shoes to navigate the cobbled streets as well as the many well-groomed hiking trails for the casual wanderer;
If you are a serious hiker, then do bring good hiking boots that you already have worn in. Woolen socks help to keep the blisters at bay. Warm and waterproof clothing is a must;
Sunglasses are necessary the higher up you go. The combination of summer sun and snow on mountain peaks is relentless and can damage your eyes. Sunblock and a hat are invaluable, especially for children;
From late fall to early spring, bring warm clothes including water resistant coats and boots for walking on snow trails and wet streets. Caps and gloves too. Even if you don't visit an Alpine resort and mainly stay in the low-lands, all this comes in handy when rain falls or low fog make the climate damp and 0 degree Celsius feel much colder then higher up;
We dress casually during the day but when you plan to enjoy nightlife as well, attend the occasional classical concert and a fancy meal in a top rated restaurant or first class hotel, it's appropriate to dress up a little - nothing elaborate but something nice that you'd weare for a special occasion, including ties for men.

So, when exactly is the best time to visit Switzerland?
Despite the unpredictability, Switzerland can be enjoyed pretty much year-round. Just plan your trip according to your interests and take whatever the weather delivers since nobody can control it.

If you want to know the best time to visit Switzerland without having to rub shoulders with hordes of tourists and still enjoy nice weather for outdoor activities and sightseeing, then I'd say late May, June and September to mid-October are your best bet.

Usually, end of May already brings warm summer weather and September to mid-October has less precipitation than July and August. The latter two months are still fabulous for hiking, and mountain transport usually closes between October 20 and 25. Later in October you experience the change of colours.

Skiing and other winter activities are best from mid-January to mid-March, though February is generally the coldest months as well as the most crowded on the slopes because of the school holidays observed throughout Europe. In fact, I love the month of March best for skiing - less crowd, sunny days but still excellent prepared slopes.

Do also check out the Festivals. There might be one or two that could interest you while you are visiting.

Airfare is most expensive during the peak tourist season, but goes up as early as April. Prices for accommodation in typical ski resorts are highest during peak ski season though hotels in cities and towns don't tend to fluctuate too much since they don't rely solely on tourists. You might get a better deal for guided tours outside the high tourist season but prices for trains, buses and boats stay the same year-round, except for the occasional promotion of Swiss Travel Passes. But they are never announced far ahead. You might get lucky or you might not. Sometimes mountain transportation offers a lower price a few days before closing, but don't rely on that.

Cheapflights always attempts to get accurate pricing, however, prices are not guaranteed.

Here's why:

Cheapflights is not the seller
Since we don’t set the prices at Cheapflights, it is not possible for us to guarantee the deals that our partners are selling.

We aggregate tons of data for you
Cheapflights allows you to quickly and easily compare results from hundreds of travel sites at once. In this sense, Cheapflights is a search engine and we can't guarantee the prices we find you.

Why aren’t prices 100% accurate?
The pricing on airline seats, hotel rooms, car rentals, train & bus tickets, vacation rentals, and packages changes regularly. It is also possible that several people may be trying to purchase the same deal at the same time as you. As a result, you may find situations where the price you intended to pay is no longer available.

While Cheapflights can’t always guarantee prices, we always try to inform our users by giving them current pricing and booking data.

If you have more questions or have found a bad price you’d like to report, please send us an email and someone from our team will get back to you promptly.

How to apply for a Switzerland visa from India ?
Do Indians nationals need a Schengen Visa to travel to Switzerland?
Yes. Although Switzerland is not in the European Union (EU), it is in the Schengen Area of countries that have abolished border controls between each others’ borders - meaning you will need a visa to Switzerland if you apply from India.

More information on how to apply for Schengen visa from India

How do I apply for a Switzerland Visa from India?
You will first need to work out which Switzerland Visa you need, depending on your purpose, the length of your trip, and how many times you plan to visit. The standard Schengen Visa, for trips lasting up to 90 days, is a short-stay visa, with longer stays requiring a work, study or family reunion visa. Multiple-entry visas are also available if you plan on traveling regularly to the Schengen Area. 

You must apply for your visa no more than six months, and no fewer than 15 days, before your trip. Then you need to fill out your application, pay a fee of €80 for adults and €40 for minors, obtain all the documents you need for your Switzerland Visa, and attend an interview at a consulate, embassy, or visa application center. Visa fees are waived for children under six years of age, those traveling to Europe for study purposes, researchers, those under 25 years old traveling with charitable organizations, and those participating in sporting or cultural events.

What is the cost of a Switzerland Visa from India?
From january 2020 the visa fees for adults for the visa to Switzerland is €80 or approx. Rs. 6400 excluding the VFS charges and service fee. For children aged 6-12 years the visa cost to Switzerland is €40 or approx. Rs. 3400.

 

What documents do I need to apply for a short-stay Switzerland Visa from India?
You will need:

two recently taken passport-style photos,
an Indian passport or other travel documents that are less than 10 years old and valid for at least three months after your departure date from Switzerland, or the Schengen Area if you plan to travel to countries after visiting Switzerland.
You will also need travel and medical insurance covering you for costs up to €30,000, evidence of legal residence in India (such as an ID card),
a cover letter stating your itinerary and the purpose of your visit,
as well as a flight itinerary and proof of accommodation during your stay,
proof of your civil status, like a marriage certificate,
and proof you have the means of subsistence during your stay.
According to Swiss law, to obtain a Switzerland Visa from India, you need to show you have at least 100 Swiss Francs per day (€92.34) for your stay in Switzerland, or, if you are a student possessing a valid student ID, 30 Swiss Francs or €27.70 per day.

What additional documents do I need to get a Switzerland Visa to work or study?
If you are planning to work or study in Switzerland for fewer than 90 days, then you will need additional documents to obtain your visa. These include an employment contract, a current bank statement, a no objection letter from your Indian employer, and an income tax return. The self-employed need an income tax return, and a company bank statement, as well as any licensing documentation. As a student, you will need proof of enrolment at an educational institution in Switzerland, and preferably a no objection letter from your current institution.

If you are looking to stay in Switzerland for longer than 90 days to study, you will need to submit your application via the Swiss Embassy in New Delhi. Since 2014, applications for long-term work permits should be applied for via your Swiss employer and be sent to authorities in the Swiss canton where you will be working.

Where do I apply for a Switzerland Visa in India?
The Swiss authorities outsource their visa applications process to the company VFS Global, which deals with initial applications on behalf of the Swiss embassy.

You can apply online via the VFS Global website visa.vfsglobal.com/ind/en/che/apply-visa, and you will need to attend an interview at a VFS Global center India, which are located in :

Mumbai,
Pune,
Puducherry,
Chennai,
Jalandhar,
Jaipur,
Hyderabad,
Goa,
New Delhi,
Kochi,
Chandigarh,
Ahmedabad,
Kolkata,
and Bengaluru.
Applications should take around 15 days but can take up to 30 days to process, especially during busy periods. However, in some cases, it may take up to 60 days.

Why choose AXA Schengen Insurance?
AXA’s Low Cost Travel Insurance costs only €0.99 ($1.11) per day of your trip and will meet your visa requirements, while the AXA Schengen Europe Travel Insurance offers extended coverage up to costs of €100,000.

Applying for a Switzerland Visa in the United States
Applying for a Switzerland Visa in the United States
Do US citizens need a visa for Switzerland?
Citizens of the United States with a valid U.S. Tourist passport (blue passport) can travel to Switzerland for a short stay of up to 90 days within a 180-day period without having to apply or obtain a Schengen visa.


Despite the fact that US citizens do not need to obtain a Switzerland visa prior to their travel to Switzerland, they still need to have some documents with them in order to be allowed to enter Switzerland. For more information check “What Documents do Americans Need to Enter Switzerland?
Note: (Starting January 1, 2023, US citizens will have to apply for an ETIAS visa prior to their travel towards Switzerland and other Schengen member states, in order to be allowed to enter the territory.)

Stat: As per 2017, Switzerland has issued a total of 451,528 uniform Schengen visas from 517,010 visa applications received at Swiss consulates and embassies around the world. The Visa rejection rate was 7.25%.

In this article, you can find information about Switzerland Visa Requirements and Application Guidelines for the US Citizens and US Residents.

Who can apply for a Visa to Switzerland from within the US?

Switzerland Visa Application Requirements
Depending on the purpose of your travel to Switzerland, there are different types of Swiss visas that will apply to the occasion.

Whether you are planning to go on a visit, study or work and reside in Switzerland permanently, you will have to apply for a different Swiss Visa, accordingly.


You can apply for the Swiss Schengen Visa since 2008 when Switzerland as an EFTA Member State also became a member state of the Schengen Area.
Switzerland Entry Restrictions in Response to Coronavirus
Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, Switzerland, as well as the rest of the EU and Schengen Area members imposed an EU-wide entry ban on third-country nationals on mid-March 2020. With the improved epidemiological situation in the EU and abroad, Switzerland has lifted the entry ban for a few third-countries and several categories of travellers.

On July 20, Switzerland intends to permit the residents of the following countries to enter its territory:

Algeria
Australia
Canada
Georgia
Japan
Morocco
New Zealand
Rwanda
South Korea
Thailand
Tunisia
Uruguay
China is expected to be removed from the list of banned countries too according to the EU recommendations, given that it does permit travellers from Switzerland to enter its territory.

At the same time, from June 6, travellers entering Switzerland from certain regions will have to go into quarantine for ten days. Travellers affected will be notified during the flight, onboard coaches and at border crossings. They will have to register with the cantonal authorities on arrival.

At the same time, starting from July 6, Switzerland will relax restrictions on the admission of workers from third countries.
